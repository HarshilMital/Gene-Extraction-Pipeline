# Gene Extraction Pipeline for Congenital Heart Disease Research Papers
This pipeline was developed as part of the course project for BIO221 - Practical Bioinformatics. Its purpose is to extract gene references from selected research papers on Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) using the Human Genome as a reference. The pipeline combines the usage of the pre-trained SciSpacy model "en_ner_bionlp13cg_md" for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and the R library BiomaRt for extracting genes from the Human Genome.
