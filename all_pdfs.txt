ABSTRACT
Background: Women who have had pregnancies that were affected
by nonsyndromic congenital heart defects have alterations in thehomocysteine-methionine pathway that may indicate increased ex-posure to oxidative stress or reduced antioxidant defense or both.Objective: Our goal was to establish a maternal metabolic risk
profile for nonsyndromic congenital heart defects that would en-hance current preventive strategies.Design: Using a case-control design, we measured biomarkers of the
transsulfuration pathway in a population-based sample of womenwhose pregnancies were affected by congenital heart defects (331cases) and in a control group of women (125 controls). Plasmaconcentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione, vitamin B-6,homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine (CysGly), and glutamyl-cysteine (GluCys) were compared between cases and controls afteradjustment for lifestyle and sociodemographic variables.Results: After covariate adjustment, cases had significantly lower
mean plasma concentrations of reduced glutathione ( P/L501410.0001),
GluCys ( P/L501410.0001), and vitamin B-6 ( P/L11550.0023) and signifi-
cantly higher mean concentrations of homocysteine ( P/L501410.0001)
and oxidized glutathione ( P/L501410.0001) than did controls.
Conclusions: Biomarkers of oxidative stress involved in the trans-
sulfuration pathway were significantly higher in women with preg-nancies affected by congenital heart defects than in women withoutsuch a history. Further analysis of relevant biomarkers of oxidativestress and genetic and environmental factors is required to define thebasis for the observed alterations. Identifying the nature and extentof alterations in biomarkers of oxidative stress may suggest primaryintervention strategies and provide clues to a greater understandingof the pathogenesis of congenital heart defects.

INTRODUCTION
Each year in the United States, /L50514150 000 babies are born with
birth defects, the leading cause of infant mortality (1). Amongthese birth defects, congenital heart defects (CHDs) are amongthe most prevalent and the most serious; they occur in /L505148–10 of
every 1000 live births (2). Approximately 40% of babies affectedby the most serious CHDs die in infancy (3). More than 85% ofCHDs are thought to result from a complex interaction betweenmaternal exposures and genetic susceptibilities (4).
Multiple studies have suggested that multivitamins containing
folic acid may reduce the risk of CHDs (5–8). Efforts to elucidatethe mechanism by which folic acid exerts a protective effect have
evaluated the metabolism of 3 folate-dependent pathways—DNA nucleotide synthesis pathway, homocysteine-methioninepathway, and glutathione-transsulfuration pathway ( Figure 1 ).
To better understand the role of folate-dependent pathways in
the occurrence of CHDs, we measured plasma concentrations ofmetabolites of the homocysteine-methionine pathway in womenwho had pregnancies that were affected by CHD and in controls(9). We and others found that women with CHD-affected preg-nancies had higher plasma homocysteine concentrations than didwomen with unaffected pregnancies (9, 10). We postulated thatelevated homocysteine may either have a direct teratogeniceffect or exert a negative effect on the developing embryonicheart through alterations in remethylation or transsulfuration orboth (9).
The metabolic pathway from homocysteine to glutathione is
referred to as the transsulfuration pathway. Approximately 50%of homocysteine generated from methionine is metabolized tocystathionine. This is an irreversible reaction that permanentlyremoves homocysteine from the methionine cycle for the syn-thesis of cysteine and glutathione (11). Elevated homocysteine is
associated with alterations in the transsulfuration pathway thatlead to greater oxidative stress (12). Experimental models havesuggested that, in addition to evidence of a direct teratogeniceffect, elevated homocysteine may have an indirect embryotoxic

 effect by increasing oxidative stress through excessive produc-
tion of reactive oxygen species and by decreasing theglutathione-dependent antioxidant-defense mechanisms (12,13). Chronic oxidative stress is also associated with low concen-trations of vitamin B-6, reduced glutathione (GSH), and cysteineand high concentrations of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (14,15). The current study expands our previous study of folate-dependent pathways by examining micronutrients and metabo-lites in the transsulfuration pathway among women with CHD-affected pregnancies.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study design and participants
Cases were identified and ascertained through the Arkansas
Reproductive Health Monitoring System, a statewide birth de-fects registry. Inclusion criteria for the cases were as follows: thewoman lived in Arkansas at the time of completion of the indexpregnancy and at the time of enrollment in the study; the outcomeof the index pregnancy was a live-born infant, stillborn infant, orelective termination; the pregnancy ended between February1998 and July 2004; a physician diagnosed a nonsyndromicseptal, conotruncal, or right- or left-sided obstructive heart de-fect, which was confirmed by prenatal or postnatal echocardio-gram, surgery, or autopsy report, or all 3; the women were En-glish or Spanish speaking; and the cases and controls hadcompleted participation in the National Birth Defects PreventionStudy (NBDPS) (16). Cases whose pregnancy was also affectedby a known single-gene disorder, chromosomal abnormality, orsyndrome were excluded; only cases with pregnancies with non-
syndromic CHDs were included. All cardiac cases were con-firmed by echocardiogram, surgery, or autopsy report and re-viewed by a single pediatric cardiologist before inclusion in thestudy.
Controls were English- or Spanish-speaking Arkansas resi-
dents who had live births that were unaffected by any birth defect;they were randomly chosen from all birth certificates registeredat the Arkansas Department of Health with birth dates betweenJune 1998 and April 2004. After ascertaining a person’s eligi-bility, a research nurse contacted the subject by mail and tele-phone, describing this study.
During scheduled home visits, the nurse obtained written in-
formed consent and used routine venipuncture to obtain a bloodsample. Cases and controls were excluded if they were pregnantat the time of the blood draw or were taking any known folate-antagonist medications. The study protocol and the provisionsfor informed consent were reviewed and approved by the Insti-tutional Review Board at the University of Arkansas for MedicalSciences.
Covariates
Each participant’s ethnicity and educational level were self-
reported during a structured computer-assisted telephone inter-view that was specifically designed for an ongoing multisitecase-control study, the NBDPS; further details regarding theNBDPS were published previously (16). At the time of the homevisit, a Block abbreviated food-frequency questionnaire (17) wasadministered, and information about the current use of multivi-tamins, cigarettes, alcohol, and caffeine intake was obtained.

 Sample preparation and biomarker measurement
Blood samples were collected into evacuated tubes (B-D Bio-
sciences, Dallas, TX) containing EDTA and immediately chilledon ice before being centrifuged at 4000 /L1154gfor 10 min at 4 °C.
Plasma aliquots were transferred into cryostat tubes and stored at/L115280 °C until extraction and HPLC quantification.
To measure total homocysteine, cysteine, and GSH concen-
trations, 50
/H9262L of a freshly prepared solution to reduce all sulf-
hydryl bonds (1.43 mmol sodium borohydride/L, 1.5 /H9262mol
EDTA/L, 66 mmol NaOH/L, and 10 /H9262L isoamyl alcohol was
added to 200 /H9262L plasma. The samples were incubated at 40 °C in
a shaker for 30 min. To precipitate proteins, 250 /H9262L ice-cold 10%
metaphosphoric acid was added and mixed well, and samples wereincubated for an additional 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at18 000/L1154gfor 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant fluid was filtered
through a 0.2-
/H9262m nylon membrane filter (PGC Scientific, Freder-
ick, MD), and a 20- /H9262L aliquot was injected into the HPLC system.
To measure oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations, 100
/H9262L of 10% metaphosphoric acid was added to 200 /H9262L plasma to
precipitate proteins; the solution was mixed well and incubatedon ice for 30 min. After centrifugation for 15 min at 18 000 /L1154g
at 4 °C, supernatant fluids were passed through a 0.2-
/H9262m nylon
membrane filter, and 20 /H9262L was injected into the HPLC system.
Plasma concentrations of pyridoxal-5 /H11032-phosphate (vitamin B-6)
were measured by using an HPLC method developed by Lequeuet al (18) with slight modifications for the use of coulometricelectrochemical detection.
Details of the method for HPLC elution and electrochemical
detection were described previously (19, 20). Separation of me-tabolites was performed by using HPLC with a Shimadzusolvent-delivery system (model 580; ESA Inc, Chelmsford, MA)and a reverse-phase 5-
/H9262mC18column (4.6 /L1154150 mm; MCM
Inc, Tokyo, Japan) obtained from ESA Inc. A 20- /H9262L aliquot of
plasma extract was directly injected onto the column by usingautosamplers from ESA Inc (model 542) or Beckman (model507E; Beckman Instruments, Irvine, CA). All plasma metabo-lites were quantified by using Coulochem II (model 5200A) andCoulArray (model 5600) electro chemical detection systems
equipped with a dual analytic cell (model 5010), a 4-channel ana-lytic cell (model 6210), and a guard cell (model 5020; all from ESAInc). The unknown concentrations of plasma metabolites were cal-culated from peak areas and standard calibration curves with the useof HPLC software.
Statistical analysis
Because of the skewed distribution of these measurements,
Wilcoxon’s Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used to comparealcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, caffeine intake, andinterval between pregnancy and participation. All plasma bi-omarkers exhibited positively skewed distributions; therefore, toachieve normality, biomarker data were log transformed (naturallog) before analysis. Mean log-transformed biomarker concen-trations of cases and controls were compared by using a Student’sttest, whereas linear regression was used to adjust these com-
parisons for age, race, education level, breastfeeding status, mul-tivitamin supplement intake, smoking, alcohol consumption,caffeine intake, and interval between the end of pregnancy andthe blood draw. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and cor-responding 95% CIs for the association between plasma biomar-kers and case or control status were computed by using logisticregression. Analyses were performed with SAS statistical soft-
ware (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
As shown in Table 1 , of the 331 cases and 125 controls
included in this study, /L5051477.0% were white. At the time of the
blood draw, 63.7% of the cases were /L5014130 y old, and less than half
(45.0%) of the cases reported alcohol consumption. There was nosignificant difference between the percentage of cases (44.4%)and the percentage of controls (44.8%) who reported regularmultivitamin use at the time of the blood draw. Smoking wassignificantly ( P/L11550.0401) more prevalent among cases (28.1%)
than among controls (18.4%), but caffeine intake did not varysignificantly between cases and controls ( P/L11550.2838).
We previously reported on the plasma concentrations of ho-
mocysteine and folate among a subset of these women (9). In thecurrent study, we included homocysteine and folate and alsomeasured the plasma concentrations of GSH and GSSG, cys-teineylglycine (CysGly), glutamylcysteine (GluCys), and cys-teine ( Table 2 ). We compared log-transformed mean concen-
trations between cases and controls after adjustment for lifestyleand sociodemographic variables. Compared with controls, caseshad significantly lower mean plasma concentrations of GSH(P/L501410.0001), GluCys ( P/L501410.0001), and vitamin B-6 ( P/L1155
0.0023); significantly higher mean concentrations of homocys-teine ( P/L501410.0001) and GSSG ( P/L501410.0001); and a significantly
higher ratio of GSSG to GSH ( P/L501410.0001).
The concentrations of homocysteine, GluCys, GSH, vitamin
B-6, and GSSG and GSSG:GSH were further compared betweencases and controls by computing crude ORs at various cutoffs onthe basis of the percentile distribution of controls ( Table 3 ). Of
the 331 cases, 194 (58.6%) had homocysteine concentrationsabove the 70th percentile in controls, and 39.3% had concentra-tions above the 90th percentile in controls; 178 cases (54.1%) hadplasma concentrations of GSSG above the 70th percentile ofcontrols, and 151 cases (46.0%) had GSSG:GSH above the 90thpercentile of the ratio distribution among controls. More thanhalf of the cases had GSH concentrations that were below the30th percentile of GSH in controls. These distributional differencesremained important after covariate adjustment. The ORs for eachmetabolite increase or decrease in a dose-dependent manner, whichsuggests that risk increases as the metabolite value moves toward theextremes. Specifically, the OR at the most extreme values of GSSG:GSH was 9.08 (95% CI: 4.6, 17.9). Thus, if a woman had GSSG:GSH/L501400.055, she was 9 times as likely to have a CHD-affected
pregnancy as an unaffected pregnancy.
DISCUSSION
In a previous publication (9), evidence of impairment in
remethylation of homocysteine was shown by lower methio-nine and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations and higher
S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations among women with
CHD-affected pregnancies. Our current findings indicate that thehigher homocysteine observed among women with CHD-affected pregnancies may extend beyond impairments in re-methylation of homocysteine to impairments in the transsulfu-ration of homocysteine. Specifically, in comparison to controls,cases with CHD-affected pregnancies had significantly lowerconcentrations of vitamin B-6, GluCys, and GSH and signifi-cantly higher concentrations of GSSG.600 HOBBS ET ALDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/82/3/598/4862988 by guest on 11 May 2023
 We found that cases were 2.9 times as likely as were controls
to have plasma vitamin B-6 concentrations in the lowest percen-tile. Despite this difference in plasma vitamin B-6 concentra-tions, dietary and total intake of vitamin B-6 from diet plussupplements did not differ significantly between cases and con-
trols (adjusted P/L11550.9740 and 0.9520, respectively). Vitamin
B-6 is necessary to convert homocysteine to cystathionine andthen to cysteine (15, 21). Limited evidence is available regardingTABLE 1

 the role of vitamin B-6 in CHD-affected pregnancies. Pericon-
ceptional intake of multivitamins containing folic acid wasshown in some studies to reduce the risk of CHDs (8). VitaminB-6 is also likely to be a component of most multivitamin prep-arations. Boneva et al (22) reported that women in a case-controlstudy conducted in 1982-1983 who took a formulation of Ben-dectin (Merrell Dow Pharmaceutics, Midland, MI: removedfrom the market in 1983) including vitamin B-6 for nausea andvomiting in pregnancy were significantly less likely to have aninfant with a CHD than were women in a control group. Thoseinvestigators postulated, on the basis of their findings and thoseof animal studies (23), that both folic acid and vitamin B-6 mayhave a protective effect on embryonic heart development. Lowerplasma vitamin B-6 concentrations have also been found amongwomen with pregnancies that were affected by orofacial cleftsthan among controls (24, 25).
We also found that women with CHD-affected pregnancies
had significantly higher GSSG:GSH. The redox GSSG:GSH is amarker of increased oxidative stress (15, 26, 27). Thus, our find-ings may indicate alterations in the delicate balance betweenoxidative stress and antioxidant defense mechanisms amongwomen who have pregnancies that are affected by CHDs.Consistent with this hypothesis are the recent findings byseveral investigators of the antioxidant properties of vitaminB-6 (28–30).
Evidence for oxidative embryopathy is based largely on ani-
mal studies that allow experimental manipulation of the timingand dose of oxidant exposure that is not possible in human studies(31, 32). In animal models, glutathione depletion and oxidativestress have been strongly implicated in the etiology of multiple
birth defects (31, 33). Depending on the timing and duration ofexposure, the functional consequences of oxidative injury mayinduce embryopathy and dysmorphogenesis (31, 32). The devel-oping fetus may be exposed to potentially teratogenic reactiveoxygen species, and normal organogenesis may depend on acritical balance of antioxidant activity and prooxidant exposuresthat are modifiable by genetic or environmental factors, or both.
Despite abundant supportive evidence from animal studies,
limited human studies have been conducted on the associationbetween birth defects and glutathione-mediated oxidative stress.Genetic epidemiologic studies support an association betweenorofacial clefts and phase II detoxification enzymes that protectcells from toxicants by conjugation with glutathione. Risk esti-mates of orofacial clefts were high among women exposed tohydrocarbons whose infants had a glutathione-S transferase M1homozygous variant genotype (34). Mothers and infants with theglutathione-S transferase T1 null genotype had 5 times the risk ofnonsyndromic oral facial clefting as did mother-infant pairs withthe wild-type genotype (35).
Important methodologic limitations of our study should be
considered. The blood obtained to measure biomarkers was col-lected well after the index pregnancies had ended. As we previ-ously postulated (9), plasma concentrations of biomarkers in ourstudy may not represent biomarker concentrations at the time oforganogenesis, but they may identify women who have persis-tent metabolic imbalances in homocysteine metabolism. Ourfindings suggest that a persistent and, perhaps, preexisting in-crease in oxidative stress results in depletions in the glutathioneTABLE 3

 antioxidant defense mechanism that may place women at risk of
having a CHD-affected pregnancy.
We did not examine the relation between cardiac phenotypes
and biomarkers. Some particular cardiac phenotypes may bemore influenced by altered glutathione metabolism than are oth-ers. The medical charts of control infants were thoroughly re-viewed and abstracted by trained health information manage-ment professionals, and the findings were reviewed by studyphysicians. Any control infant diagnosed with a congenital birthdefect was excluded. However, echocardiograms were not rou-tinely performed on control infants to definitively rule out acardiac lesion. Thus, it is possible that some of the control infantsmay have had minor cardiac lesions that were never detected anddocumented in their medical record.
The basis for the abnormal metabolic profile observed in the
current study cannot be defined without further analysis of rel-evant genetic and lifestyle factors. Alterations in the transsulfu-ration pathway among women whose infants had CHDs providean informative metabolic map for candidate gene exploration.For example, we observed that GSH and GluCys were signifi-cantly lower in cases than in controls, but cysteine and CysGlydid not differ significantly between the groups (Figure 1). Thisobservation suggests that polymorphisms in the GluCys ligasegene, which encodes an enzyme that is rate-limiting for gluta-thione synthesis, may contribute to the complex etiology of non-syndromic CHDs. Further studies are needed to determinewhether polymorphisms in the GluCys ligase gene and othergenes in the transsulfuration pathway contribute to the develop-ment of CHDs.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show abnormal
glutathione metabolism among women with a history of a preg-nancy affected by CHDs. If our findings are replicated by otherinvestigators, further investigations into the association betweenCHDs and the glutathione antioxidant defense mechanism mayprovide new etiologic clues about the underlying mechanism ofnonsyndromic CHDs. Efforts that combine information frommetabolic studies with genetic and epidemiologic studies mayidentify novel primary prevention strategies.

Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most prevalence birth defects in the world. The
pathogenesis of CHD is complex and unclear. With the development of metabolomics technology, the
variations in metabolites may provide a new clue for CHD occurrence and may serve as a biomarker
during pregnancy.
Method: Maternal amniotic  uid (AF) samples during second and third trimester were utilized to analyze
the metabolomics of CHD and normal fetuses. Differential comparison and randomForest were used to
screen metabolic biomarkers.
Results: A total of 2472 metabolites were detected and they were distributed differentially between the
cases and controls. Setting the selection criteria of fold change (FC) ≥  2, p value < 0.01 and the variable
importance for the projection (VIP) ≥  1.5, we screened out 118 differential metabolites. Within the
prediction model by randomForest, PE(MonoMe(11,5)/MonoMe(13,5)), N-feruloylserotonin and 2,6-Di-tert-
butylbenzoquinone were showed good prediction effect. Differential metabolites were mainly
concentrated in aldosterone synthesis and secretion, drug metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide
metabolism pathways, which may be related to the occurrence and development of CHD.
Conclusion: This study provides a new database on CHD metabolic biomarkers and mechanism research.
These results need to be further veri ed in larger samples. 
Key Points
What's already known about this topic?
The pathogenesis of congenital heart disease (CHD) is complex and unclear. Metabolomics could detect
the changes of metabolites produced by biological systems which may provide a new clue for CHD
occurrence and serve as a biomarker for diagnosis.
What does this study add?
Metabolites in maternal amniotic  uid were distributed differentially between the CHD cases and
controls. Differential metabolites may serve as screen biomarkers. They were mainly concentrated in
three key pathways.
1. Introduction
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a structural abnormality caused by the formation or abnormal
development of the heart and large blood vessels during embryonic development. CHD is one of the most
prevalence of birth defects in the world 1. The worldwide prevalence of CHD in live births was rising
during the previous 40 years and reached 9.41 ‰  during 2010-2017 1. The etiologies of CHD occurrence
are complex. It is reported that less than 30% of CHDs are caused by clear environmental or genetic Page 3/20factors, and more unknown causes are considered to be the result of the interaction of environmental and
genetic factors 2 3. However, most of the in uencing factors have not been fully con rmed till now, and
the teratogenic mechanism is still lack of su cient evidence, which seriously restricts the formulation
and implementation of effective interventions for CHD. The cause and etiological mechanism of
congenital heart disease have been studied for decades, but there is no obvious breakthrough on the clear
etiological mechanism. It is urgent to explore new ways on the research of the etiology of CHD from new
perspective and directions.
The heart is the  rst functional organ developed in the embryo. The primitive heart tube begins to form in
the 3rd week of the embryo, and plays a role in circulation in the 4th week. By the 8th week, the atrial and
ventricular septa are fully grown, and the connection of the fundus arteries and veins is completed 4. If it
was affected by any teratogenic factors during the period, there may be abnormal development of the
heart or large blood vessels. At this stage, the diagnosis of congenital heart disease is mainly
concentrated in the second trimester, using ultrasound echocardiography. 5 However, the level of CHD
diagnosis is greatly limited by ultrasound technology in different hospitals 6 7 and echocardiography
itself has some limitations 6 8. Furthermore, CHD is not constant during pregnancy , and its severity or
self-recovery situation are dynamically changing 9. Therefore, whether a relatively objective inspection
methods could be developed to increase the prediction effect of CHD development need be considered. 
Metabolomics can quantitatively detect the changes of all metabolites produced by biological systems
(cells, tissues or organisms) after external stimuli or genetic modi cation 10. Metabolomics can discover
disease-related small molecule compounds by studying the internal changes of biological systems.
Through understanding disease-speci c metabolites, it provides a theoretical basis for exploring the
pathogenesis of maternal-fetal diseases and searching for disease-related biomarkers 11 12.
Metabolomics has been used in the studies of congenital heart disease during recent years 13 14. The
variate metabolites could provide important clues to explore the pathogenesis and biomarkers of CHD.
Previous studies have used biological samples such as maternal serum 15, urine 16 17, and amniotic  uid
(AF) 18 to detect metabolites to explore biomarkers of congenital heart disease. However, the types of
detectable metabolites are limited. Those results are inconsistent, and the possible mechanism remains
unclear. In this study, amniotic  uid in the second and third trimesters was used as the research material,
and a new metabolomic research method about untargeted metabolomic assays was used to analyze the
speci c metabolic markers in AF. At the same time, we will explore the metabolic mechanism of
congenital heart disease to provide more research evidence.
2. Materials And Methods
2.1. Study population and sampling
This project was based on a multi-center hospital-based case-control study. Pregnant women who
performed prenatal diagnosis during the second trimester were recruited from three hospitals in China 19. Page 4/20Mothers whose fetuses were prenatally diagnosed with CHDs or without any anomalies were initially
chosen as the cases and the controls, respectively. The phenotype was diagnosed by sonographers,
pathologists, and pediatricians through systematic ultrasound, autopsy, or postnatal follow-up 19 20.
Cases were de ned as isolated congenital heart disease without other extracardiac malformations, and
controls were de ned as fetuses without any birth defects. The subtypes of CHD cases were listed in
Table 1. Both cases and controls were singletons without family history of CHD. 
A structured questionnaire-based interview was used to collect subjects’ information when pregnant
women were signed informed consent 32, 33. After interview, 5ml of amniotic  uid was extracted in the
procedure of amniocentesis with the mother's consent. The amniotic  uid was centrifuged and
supernatant were stored in aliquots at -70 ° C until analysis. This study was approved by the Medical
Ethics Committee of Sichuan University (ID: 2010004) and West China Second University Hospital (ID:
2015(011)). All subjects provided informed consent to participate and then joined the process. The
samples and information were obtained from the project biobank.

2.2. Sample Pretreatment.
100 μ L of Amniotic  uid supernatant was transferred to an EP tube, and added 400 μ L extract solution
(acetonitrile: methanol = 1: 1)( CNW Technologies) containing isotopically-labelled internal standard Page 5/20mixture. After procedures of vortex, sonicated, ice-water bath, incubated and centrifuged, 400 μ L of
supernatant was transferred to a fresh glass vial and dried in a vacuum concentrator at 37  ℃ . Then, the
dried samples were reconstituted in 200 μ L of 50% acetonitrile and repeat the above steps. 75 μ L of
supernatant was transferred to a fresh glass vial for LC/MS analysis. The quality control (QC) sample
was prepared by mixing an equal aliquot of the supernatants from all of the samples.
2.3. Metabolomic Measurements
The Ultra (high) performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) separation was carried out using a ExionLC
In nity series UHPLC System (AB Sciex), equipped with a UPLC BEH Amide column (2.1 * 100 mm, 1.7
μm, Waters). The mobile phase consisted of 25 mmol/L ammonium acetate and 25 mmol/L ammonia
hydroxide ( CNW Technologies) in water pH = 9.75 (A) and acetonitrile (B). The analysis was carried with
elution gradient. The column temperature was 25 ℃ . The auto-sampler temperature was 4  ℃ , and the
injection volume was 2 μ L (pos) or 2 μ L (neg), respectively. 
The TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometry (AB Sciex) was used for its ability to acquire MS/MS spectra on
an information-dependent basis (IDA) during LC/MS experiment. In this mode, the acquisition software
(Analyst TF 1.7, AB Sciex) continuously evaluates the full scan survey MS data as it collected and
triggered the acquisition of MS/MS spectra depending on preselected criteria. In each cycle, the most
intensive 12 precursor ions with intensity above 100 were chosen for MS/MS at collision energy (CE) of
30 eV. The UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis were tested in Biomarker Technologies Corporation, Beijing, China
(https://international.biocloud.net/).
2.4 Statistical Analysis
2.4.1. Descriptive statistics 
A case-control analysis was performed to assess the variations in metabolites on CHDs. The
personalized features included maternal age, maternal prepregnancy Body Mass Index (ppBMI), fetal
gender (male, female), and gravidity. The frequency was used to describe qualitative data, and
continuous variables were described as quantitative data using the mean and SD. Differences in the
frequencies of these factors between cases and controls were assessed using Chi-square test or
Student’s t-test.
2.4.2. Metabolomics data processing
Mass spectrometry (MS) raw data (.wiff)  les were converted to the mzXML format by ProteoWizard. The
process including peak deconvolution, alignment and integration were processed by R package XCMS
(version 3.2). Minfrac and cut off are set as 0.5 and 0.3 respectively. In-house MS2 database was applied
for metabolites identi cation.
Metabolomics data were analyzed using SIMCA-P14.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) software for
differentially grouped principal component analysis (PCA), Fold change (FC) analysis, orthogonal partial Page 6/20least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and unsupervised clustering analysis. Dimensionality
reduction and sorting of metabolites were performed to screen for differential metabolites. The methods
of combining the multiple of FC, the P value of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test, the variable
importance for the projection (VIP) value of the OPLS-DA model and the multivariate logistic regression
analysis were used to screen the differential metabolites and mapping. 
2.4.3. Metabolic biomarker screening
The random forest (RF) method was used to select the most in uential markers. RF was implemented
using the ‘randomForest’ function from the ‘randomForest’ package in R21. Besides, receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve was used to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) score and 95% interval
con dence (95% CI) of each selected marker. Logistic regression model including these selected markers
were conducted, and Akaike Information criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information criterion (BIC), Positive
Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and AUC score were used to estimate the
performance of the model for classifying the subjects. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis was
conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model. 
2.4.4 Metabolic pathway analysis
The classi cation information of differential metabolites was annotated by using the HMDB (Human
Metabolome Database, https://hmdb.ca/) and KEGG ((Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes,
https://www.kegg.jp/) databases. The enrichment analysis and statistical drawing of the annotated
differential metabolites were performed. 
All the analyses were carried out using R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
http://www.r-project.org). Two-tailed values of P < 0.05 were considered signi cant. 
3. Results

3.2 Metabolomics detection results
Sixty- ve samples were subjected to untargeted metabolomic assays and a total of 2472 metabolites
were identi ed. All metabolites were evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA), sample cluster
analysis and repeated correlation evaluation. There was a certain degree of distinction between the case
and control group (Figure 1A,1B, Figure S1).
Orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of differential group of cases
and controls was performed to obtain more reliable information on the degree of correlation between
group differences in metabolites and experimental groups. In this model, R2Y was 0.984, and Q2 was
0.692. The results were shown in Figure 1C,1D. The OPLS-DA result showed that there was a signi cant
difference in metabolic pro les between CHDs and controls in AF.

3.3 Biomarker screening and validation
3.3.1. Differential metabolites screening
For those with biological replicates, the method of combining the fold change (FC), the P value of the T
test and the VIP value of the OPLS-DA model was used to screen the differential metabolites. The Page 8/20screening criteria was FC>2, P value<0.01, VIP> 1.50. A total of 118 differential metabolites were
screened, of which 59 were up-regulated and 59 were down-regulated. The results were shown with the
volcano map in Figure S1.
3.3.2. Results of randomForest
The more values below the detection limit, the less accurate the representation of the metabolite may be.
Hence, we selected the candidate markers, with the detection value of 0 in less than 10% of subjects and
36 markers were selected from the 118 markers. Then, we selected 10 markers with average VIP ≥  1.8 as
the most in uential markers for the following analysis.
When the number of decision tree (ntree) was 38, and the number of variables contained in each decision
tree (mtry) was 9, oob error was minor and tended to stable (Figure S2, Figure S3). As is shown in  gure 2,
meta_1461 emerged as the most important input variable followed by meta_1587 and meta_901 (all of
the above markers have a Mean Decrease Accuracy > 4.0). Less important variables included meta_838,
meta_1024, meta_1195, meta_2137, meta_2373, meta_1261, and meta_1354 (all of the these markers
have a Mean Decrease Accuracy < 4.0). We used logistic regression model to assess the performance of
the combination of these markers whose Mean Decrease Accuracy > 4.0 for predicting the class of the
subjects. The confusion matrix was shown in Figure S4. 
3.3.3. Performance of selected markers
The ROC curve is the plot of the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the True Negative Rate (TNR) at varying
classi cation thresholds. The ROC curves compared the performances of meta_1461, meta_901 and
meta_1587 for classifying the subjects. It showed that meta_1461 performed best, with an AUC score of
89.6% (95% CI: 81.4%, 91.7%) (Fig.3A). The meta_1587 comes the second (AUC score: 85.6%, 95% CI:
76.1%, 95.2%), followed by the meta_901 (AUC score: 85.0%, 95%CI: 75.7%, 94.4%) (Fig.3A).
The ROC curve of the model was shown in Fig. 3B, with the AUC score of 98.8%. Further, we also did
sensitive analysis with some covariates included into the logistic regression model, such as: maternal
age, maternal prepregnancy Body Mass Index (ppBMI), fetal sex (boy, girl), and the number of pregnancy
times. It showed the AUC score (99.5%) of the adjusted model (with covariates adjusted in the model)
was similar to that (98.8%) of the model without any covariates adjusted. The AIC decreased from 25.15
to 23.68, and BIC increased from 33.85 to 38.90 (Fig.3B).

To sum up, the metabolite biomarker screening process and results were showed in Figure 4.
3.4 Metabolic pathway analysis Page 9/20Differential metabolites were annotated by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database
and HMDB (Human Metabolome Database). The hypergeometric test was used in Cluster Pro ler to
perform enrichment analysis on the annotation results of the differential metabolites KEGG. The results
showed that the differential metabolites were mainly concentrated in glycerophospholipids, fatty acyls
and prenol lipids classi cations (Fig.5A). And these metabolites are enriched in aldosterone synthesis
and secretion, drug metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathways (Fig.5B).

4. Discussion
In this study, the distribution characteristics of amniotic  uid metabolites in the CHDs and the controls
were obtained through untargeted metabolomics detection. The possible biomarkers for CHD occurrence
or development were screened and veri ed. We also explored the possible mechanisms for differential
metabolites in the occurrence of CHD. It provided basic data resources for the research of congenital
heart disease with a new perspective.
Congenital heart disease is one of the most common birth defects 1, and the diagnosis of the disease is
overly dependent on the technical level of ultrasonography 5. 
Metabolomics is an extension of genomics, which can more intuitively re ect the pro ling of metabolites
in bio uids, cells and tissues, is routinely applied as a tool for biomarker discovery 22. Owing to
innovative developments in informatics and analytical technologies, and the integration of orthogonal
biological approaches, it becomes possible to expand metabolomic analyses to understand the systems-
level effects of metabolites at present, which can be used for CHD screening or to explore the mechanism
study of occurrence and development of CHD.
A study conducted a serum metabolomics study on children with congenital heart disease and found that
13 metabolites showed a signi cant increase or decrease trend. Taurine, glutamine, and glutamate
presented considerable diagnostic value for diagnosis of CHD14. Some researchers performed
metabolomics detection on the serum of patients with congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and
controls13. A total of 2213 metabolites were detected and 41 differential metabolites were identi ed. A
predictive model for estimating group BAV was established using the concentration levels of
monoglyceride (MG) (18:2) and glycerophosphate-N-oleoethanolamine (GNOE). Those studies supported
the value of serum-based metabolomic pro ling methods as an adjunct tool for screening large
populations.
However, it is relatively rare to study the occurrence of CHD through biological samples of pregnant
mothers. Amniotic  uid, as the fetus growing environment, is relatively stable in the middle and late
pregnancy stages. Compared with maternal blood, urine and other samples, it can better re ect the actual Page 10/20metabolic state of the fetus. The urine excreted by the fetus after the second trimester is an important
source of amniotic  uid, and the metabolites in the fetus will also be re ected by the amniotic  uid with
the excretion of urine. Amniotic  uid not only provides a mechanical buffer for the fetus to prevent limb
adhesion, but also provides nutrients and growth factors, transports metabolites, and more. At the same
time, the physiological and biochemical levels of amniotic  uid also re ect the health status of the fetus.
Accurate and sensitive details of birth defect-related metabolites and their respective biochemical
pathways can be obtained through amniotic  uid metabolomics, which also allows a better
understanding of the overall pathophysiology of affected pregnancies
In terms of metabolomic methods, a total of 2472 metabolites were identi ed using the UHPLC-QTOF-MS
untargeted metabolomics detection in this study. Many new metabolites were found compared to
previous studies, which mostly used NMR or GC-TOF-MS methods, could only detect hundreds of
metabolites 15-18. UHPLC increasingly displacing conventional high performance liquid
chromatography 23 LC-MS is the main workhorse of metabolomics owing to its high degree of analytical
sensitivity and speci city when measuring diverse chemistry in complex biological
samples24.  Untargeted metabolomics detection method can identify as many metabolites as possible by
comparing characteristic peak ion with standard databases, and use semi-quantitative metabolite
content to obtain high-throughput metabolomics data 23. Untargeted metabolomics is a powerful tool
that can provide new clues for prenatal diagnosis 12 It will be helpful for discovering affected metabolic
pathways, reveal disease pathogenesis, and propose potential biomarkers22. 
The method of combining the fold change, the P value of the t test and the VIP value of the OPLS-DA
model was utilized to screen the differential metabolites, and the machine algorithm of randomForest
(RF) was exploited to screen the biomarkers. The randomForest is an ensemble learning method that
operates by constructing a collection of decision trees25, and for variable selection, it performs good
across sample sizes26.  Besides, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to estimate the
area under the curve (AUC) score and 95% interval con dence (95% CI) of each selected marker. We also
evaluate the combined distinguish ability of these makers, using logistic regression model. The results
shows PE(MonoMe(11,5)/MonoMe(13,5)), 4-[N-(p-Coumaroyl) serotonin-4''-yl] -N-
feruloylserotonin and 2,6-Di-tert-butylbenzoquinone in maternal amniotic  uid performs good in
distinguishing cases from controls.
PE(MonoMe(11,5)/MonoMe(13,5)), called 13-(3-methyl-5-pentylfuran-2-yl) tridecanoate, a kind of
dimethylfuran fatty acid, is abundant in  sh oil and easy to be oxidized and degraded 27. There are few
reports about this chemical, and is only found decreased in patients with gastrointestinal diseases 28. 4-
[N-(p-Coumaroyl)serotonin-4''-yl]-N-feruloylserotonin is a serotonin derivative with trace distribution in
medicinal plants such as sa ower29. They have strong scavenging free radicals and anti-lipid
peroxidation ability, anti-tumor activity, anti-in ammatory and bacteriostatic effect, and inhibiting the
production of melanin and other functional activities. This substance has the potential for the study of
atherosclerosis and aortic wall distention 30. 2,6-Di-tert-butylbenzoquinone, one of cyclic NIAS originating Page 11/20from food packaging, has not been found to be associated with disease occurrence. But the similar
substance 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone can be set as a reversible inhibitor in cardiac cells
through intracellular Ca2+ handling in ventricular myocytes 31. 
This study found that the differential metabolites were mainly concentrated in several metabolic
pathways, and it was inferred that aldosterone synthesis, drug metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide
metabolism played a very important role in the occurrence and development of CHD. The secretion of
aldosterone is mainly regulated by renin-angiotensin, a hormone that regulates blood volume in the
human body. It maintains water balance by regulating the reabsorption of sodium in kidneys. Excessive
circulating and tissue angiotensin II (AngII) and aldosterone levels lead to a pro- brotic, -in ammatory,
and -hypertrophic milieu 32 that causes remodeling and dysfunction in cardiovascular and renal
tissues 33. Nicotinate and nicotinamide are collectively referred to as vitamin 22. Nicotinamide forms the
coenzyme I and coenzyme II with ribose, phosphate and adenine in the body. They are the coenzymes of
many dehydrogenases and are associated with many metabolic processes including glucose glycolysis,
fat metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, which are closely related to the formation of high-energy
phosphate bonds 34. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a
substrate for enzymes response to energy stress and oxidative stress, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD +) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart failure. Niacin turns
into niacinamide in the body to play the above role. In addition, niacin also has a strong peripheral
vasodilator effect. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is synthesized de novo from tryptophan
through the kynurenine pathway. The patients showed the reduced levels of circulating NAD. Defects
similar to those in the patients developed in the embryos of Haao-null or Kynu-null mice owing to NAD
de ciency. and the prevention of NAD de ciency during gestation could averte defects 35. These results
would provide additional new metabolites data sources for the CHD, and suggest a new idea for further
mechanism exploration of CHD.
Of course, this study also has some shortcomings: the sample size is relatively small, and no external
database is used for veri cation. The future study would focus on larger sample size for in-depth
analysis and validation.

Abstract 
Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most prevalent birth defects in the world. The pathogen-
esis of CHD is complex and unclear. With the development of metabolomics technology, variations in metabolites 
may provide new clues about the causes of CHD and may serve as a biomarker during pregnancy.
Methods: Sixty-five amniotic fluid samples (28 cases and 37 controls) during the second and third trimesters were 
utilized in this study. The metabolomics of CHD and normal fetuses were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics tech-
nology. Differential comparison and randomForest were used to screen metabolic biomarkers.
Results: A total of 2472 metabolites were detected, and they were distributed differentially between the cases 
and controls. Setting the selection criteria of fold change (FC) ≥ 2, P value < 0.01 and variable importance for the 
projection (VIP) ≥ 1.5, we screened 118 differential metabolites. Within the prediction model by random forest, 
PE(MonoMe(11,5)/MonoMe(13,5)), N-feruloylserotonin and 2,6-di-tert-butylbenzoquinone showed good prediction 
effects. Differential metabolites were mainly concentrated in aldosterone synthesis and secretion, drug metabolism, 
nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathways, which may be related to the occurrence and development of 
CHD.
Conclusion: This study provides a new database of CHD metabolic biomarkers and mechanistic research. These 
results need to be further verified in larger samples.

What is already known about this topic?
The pathogenesis of congenital heart disease (CHD) 
is complex and unclear. Metabolomics could detect the 
changes in metabolites produced by biological systems, which may provide a new clue for CHD occurrence and 
serve as a biomarker for diagnosis.
What does this study add?
Metabolites in maternal amniotic fluid were distributed 
differentially between the CHD cases and controls. Dif -
ferential metabolites may serve as screening biomarkers. 
They were mainly concentrated in three key pathways.

development. CHD is one of the most prevalent of 
birth defects in the world [1]. The worldwide prevalence 
of CHD in live births was rising during the previous 
40 years and reached 9.41‰ during 2010–2017 [1]. The 
etiologies of CHD occurrence are complex. It is reported 
that less than 30% of CHDs are caused by clear environ -
mental or genetic factors, and the unknown causes are 
considered to be the result of interactions between envi -
ronmental and genetic factors [2, 3]. However, most of 
the influencing factors have not been fully confirmed utill 
now, and the teratogenic mechanism is still lacks suffi -
cient evidence, which seriously restricts the formulation 
and implementation of effective interventions for CHD. 
The cause and etiological mechanism of congenital heart 
disease have been studied for decades, but there is no 
obvious breakthrough providing a clear etiological mech -
anism. It is urgent to explore new ways to research the 
etiology of CHD from new perspectives and directions.
The heart is the first functional organ developed in the 
embryo. The primitive heart tube begins to form in the 
3rd week of the embryo and plays a role in circulation in 
the 4th week. By the 8th week, the atrial and ventricu -
lar septa are fully grown, and the connection of the fun -
dus arteries and veins is completed [4]. If it was affected 
by any teratogenic factors during this period, there may 
be abnormal development of the heart or large blood 
vessels.
Currently, the diagnosis of congenital heart disease 
is mainly concentrated in the second trimester, using 
ultrasound echocardiography. [5] However, the preci -
sion of CHD diagnosis is greatly limited by ultrasound 
technology in different hospitals [6, 7], and echocardi -
ography itself has some limitations [6, 8]. Some mild 
CHD subtypes, such as isolated coarctation of the aorta 
(CoA), could not be identified until after birth [9]. Fur -
thermore, CHD is not constant during pregnancy, and it 
may be dynamically change. For example, up to 60–80% 
of ventricular septal defects (VSD) can spontaneously 
recover [10, 11]. Therefore, whether a relatively objective 
inspection method could be developed to increase the 
prediction effect of CHD in later development needs be 
considered.
Metabolomics can quantitatively detect the changes 
in all metabolites produced by biological systems (cells, 
tissues or organisms) after external stimuli or genetic 
modification [12]. Metabolomics can discover disease-
related small molecule compounds by studying the 
internal changes of biological systems. Understand -
ing disease-specific metabolites provides a theoretical 
basis for exploring the pathogenesis of maternal–fetal 
diseases and searching for disease-related biomark -
ers [13, 14]. Metabolomics has been used in studies of 
congenital heart disease in recent years [15, 16]. The variable metabolites could provide important clues for 
exploring the pathogenesis and biomarkers of CHD.
Previous studies have used biological samples such as 
maternal serum [17], urine [18, 19], and amniotic fluid 
(AF) [20] to detect metabolites for exploring biomarkers 
of congenital heart disease. However, the types of detect -
able metabolites are limited. The results are inconsist -
ent, and the possible mechanism remains unclear. In this 
study, amniotic fluid in the second and third trimesters 
was used as the research material, and a new metabo -
lomic research method involving untargeted metabo -
lomic assays was used to analyze the specific metabolic 
markers in AF. At the same time, we explored the meta -
bolic mechanism of congenital heart disease to provide 
more research evidence.
Materials and methods
Study population and sampling
This project was based on a multicenter hospital-based 
case–control study. Pregnant women who underwent 
prenatal diagnosis during the second trimester were 
recruited from three hospitals in China [21]. Mothers 
whose fetuses were prenatally diagnosed with CHDs or 
without any anomalies were initially chosen as the cases 
and the controls, respectively. The phenotype was diag -
nosed by sonographers, pathologists, and pediatricians 
through systematic ultrasound, autopsy, or postnatal fol -
low-up [21, 22]. Cases were defined as isolated congenital 
heart disease without other extracardiac malformations, 
and controls were defined as fetuses without any congen -
ital anomalies.
A structured questionnaire-based interview was used 
to collect the subjects’ information after the pregnant 
women were signed informed consent [23, 24]. Dur -
ing the follow-up process, when the subjects needed 
to undergo amniocentesis for medical reasons, 5  ml of 
amniotic fluid was extracted in the amniocentesis proce -
dure with the woman’s consent. The amniotic fluid was 
centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored in aliquots 
at -70 °C until analysis. This study was approved by the 
Medical Ethics Committee of Sichuan University (ID: 
2,010,004) and West China Second University Hospital 
(ID: 2015(011)). All subjects provided informed consent 
to participate. Here, all samples and information were 
obtained from the project biobank. The subtypes of CHD 
cases are listed in Table  1. Both cases and controls were 
singletons without a family history of CHD.
Sample pretreatment
A 100 μL sample of Amniotic fluid supernatant was trans -
ferred to an EP tube, and added 400 μL of extraction solu -
tion (acetonitrile: methanol = 1: 1) (CNW Technologies) 
containing isotopically labeled internal standard mixture  Page 3 of 11
 Yuan et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders          (2022) 22:495 
 
was added. After vortexing, sonication, ice-water bath, 
incubated and centrifugation, 400μL of supernatant was 
transferred to a fresh glass vial and dried in a vacuum 
concentrator at 37 ℃ . Then, the dried samples were 
reconstituted in 200 μL of 50% acetonitrile, and the above 
steps repeated. 75 μL of supernatant was transferred to 
a fresh glass vial for LC/MS analysis. The quality control 
(QC) sample was prepared by mixing an equal aliquot of 
the supernatants from all of the samples.
Metabolomic measurements
Ultra (high) performance liquid chromatography 
(UHPLC) separation was carried out using an ExionLC 
Infinity series UHPLC System (AB Sciex), equipped with 
a UPLC BEH Amide column (2.1 × 100  mm, 1.7  μm, 
Waters). The mobile phase consisted of 25  mmol/L 
ammonium acetate and 25 mmol/L ammonia hydroxide 
( CNW Technologies) in water (pH = 9.75) (A) and ace -
tonitrile (B). The analysis was carried out with an elution 
gradient. The column temperature was 25℃. The autosa -
mpler temperature was 4 ℃, and the injection volume 
was 2 μL (pos) or 2 μL (neg), respectively.
TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometry (AB Sciex) was used 
for its ability to acquire MS/MS spectra on an informa -
tion-dependent basis (IDA) during LC/MS experiments. 
In this mode, the acquisition software (Analyst TF 1.7, AB 
Sciex) continuously evaluates the full scan survey MS data 
as it collects and triggers the acquisition of MS/MS spectra 
depending on preselected criteria. In each cycle, the most 
intensive 12 precursor ions with intensity above 100 were 
chosen for MS/MS at a collision energy (CE) of 30 eV. In 
the detection process, standard products and blank con -
trols were strictly used for quality control, and data qual -
ity control was also carried out. The UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis was performed at Biomarker Technologies Corpo -
ration, Beijing, China (https:// inter  natio nal. biocl oud. net/).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics
A case–control analysis was performed to assess the vari -
ations in metabolites on CHDs. The personalized features 
included maternal age, maternal prepregnancy body 
mass index (ppBMI), fetal sex (male, female), and gravid -
ity. Frequency was used to describe qualitative data, and 
continuous variables were described as quantitative data 
using the mean and SD. Differences in the frequencies of 
these factors between cases and controls were assessed 
using the chi-square test or Student’s t-test.
Metabolomics data processing
Mass spectrometry (MS) raw data (.wiff) files were con -
verted to the mzXML format by ProteoWizard. The 
process including peak deconvolution, alignment and 
integration, was processed by R package XCMS (version 
3.2). Minfrac and cut off are set as 0.5 and 0.3 respec -
tively. In-house MS2 database was applied for metabolite 
identification.
Metabolomics data were analyzed using SIMCA-
P14.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) software for differen -
tially grouped principal component analysis (PCA), fold 
change (FC) analysis, orthogonal partial least squares 
discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and unsupervised clus -
tering analysis. Dimensionality reduction and sorting 
of metabolites were performed to screen for differential 
metabolites. The methods of combining the multiple of 
FC, the P value of the Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney rank 
sum test, the variable importance for the projection (VIP) 
value of the OPLS-DA model and the multivariate logis -
tic regression analysis were used to screen the differential 
metabolites and mapping.
Metabolic biomarker screening
The random forest (RF) method was used to select the 
most influential markers. RF was implemented using the 
‘randomForest’ function from the ‘randomForest’ pack -
age in R [25]. In addition, a receiver operating charac -
teristic (ROC) curve was used to estimate the area under 
the curve (AUC) score and 95% confidence interval (95% 
CI) of each selected marker. A logistic regression model 
including these selected markers was conducted, and 
the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian infor -
mation criterion (BIC), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), 
Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and AUC score were 
used to estimate the performance of the model for clas -
sifying the subjects. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model.Table 1 The subtypes of CHD cases

Metabolic pathway analysis
The classification information of differential metabolites 
was annotated by using the HMDB (Human Metabolome 
Database, https:// hmdb. ca/) and KEGG ((Kyoto Ency -
clopedia of Genes and Genomes, https:// www. kegg. jp/) 
databases. Enrichment analysis and statistical drawing of 
the annotated differential metabolites were performed.
All analyses were carried out using R version 3.6.1 (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, http:// www.r- 
proje  ct. org). Two-tailed values of P < 0.05 were consid -
ered significant.
Results
Major characteristics of the participants
After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria to 
subjects with qualified biological samples, 65 amniotic 
fluid samples (28 cases and 37 controls) were ultimately 
recruited in the present study.
The demographic characteristics are listed in Table  2 
and the individual information of the 28 CHDs are listed 
in Appendix Table S1. The proportions of gestational age 
and fetal sex were significantly different between the case 
and control groups (p < 0.05) (Table 2).
Metabolomics detection results
Sixty-five samples were subjected to untargeted metab -
olomic assays, and a total of 2472 metabolites were 
identified. All metabolites were evaluated by princi -
pal component analysis (PCA), sample cluster analysis 
and repeated correlation evaluation. The distribution 
of metabolites between the case and control groups is 
shown in Fig. 1A, Band Figure S1A/B.
Orthogonal projections to latent structures-discrimi -
nant analysis (OPLS-DA) of differential groups of cases 
and controls was performed to obtain more reliable 
information on the degree of correlation between group 
differences in metabolites and experimental groups. In 
this model, R2Y was 0.984, and Q2 was 0.692. The results 
were shown inFig.  1C, D. The OPLS-DA results showed 
that there was a significant difference in metabolic pro -
files between CHD patients and controls in AF.
Biomarker screening and validation
Differential metabolite screening
For subjects with biological replicates, the method of 
combining the fold change (FC), the P value of the t-test 
and the VIP value of the OPLS-DA model was used to 
screen the differential metabolites. The screening criteria 
were FC > 2, P value < 0.01, and VIP > 1.50. A total of 118 
differential metabolites were screened, of which 59 were 
upregulated and 59 were downregulated (listed in Table 
S2). The results are shown with the volcano map in Fig -
ure S1C.Results of randomforest
The more values below the detection limit, the less accu -
rate the representation of the metabolite may be. Hence, 
we selected the candidate markers, with a detection value 
of 0 in less than 10% of subjects and 36 markers were 
selected from the 118 markers. Then, we selected 10 
markers with an average VIP ≥ 1.8 as the most influential 
markers for the following analysis.
When the number of decision trees (ntree) was 38, 
and the number of variables contained in each decision 
tree (mtry) was 9, the out-of-bag error was minor and 
tended to stabilize (Figure S2, Figure S3). As is shown in 
Fig.  2, meta_1461 emerged as the most important input 
variable, followed by meta_1587 and meta_901 (all of the 
above markers have a Mean Decrease Accuracy > 4.0). 
Less important variables included meta_838, meta_1024, 
meta_1195, meta_2137, meta_2373, meta_1261, and 
meta_1354 (all of these markers have a Mean Decrease Table 2 Comparison of demographic characteristics between

(Fig. 3 A).
The ROC curve of the model is shown in Fig.  3B, with an 
AUC score of 98.8%. Furthermore we also performed a sen -
sitivity analysis with some covariates in the logistic regres -
sion model, such as: maternal age, maternal prepregnancy 
Body Mass Index (ppBMI), fetal sex (boy, girl), and the 
number of pregnancy times. The AUC score (99.5%) of the 
adjusted model (with covariates adjusted in the model) was 
similar to that (98.8%) of the model without any covariates 
adjusted. The AIC decreased from 25.15 to 23.68, and the 
BIC increased from 33.85 to 38.90 (Fig. 3 B).
In summary, the metabolite biomarker screening pro -
cess and results were showed in Fig. 4.
Metabolic pathway analysis
Differential metabolites were annotated by the KEGG 
(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database 
and HMDB (Human Metabolome Database). The hyper -
geometric test was used in ClusterProfiler to perform 
enrichment analysis on the annotation results of the 
KEGG differential metabolites [26]. The results showed 
that the differential metabolites were mainly concen -
trated in glycerophospholipids, fatty acyls and prenol 
lipids (Fig.  5A). These metabolites were enriched in 
aldosterone synthesis and secretion, drug metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathways 
(Fig. 5B).
Discussion
In this study, the distribution characteristics of amniotic 
fluid metabolites in CHDs and the controls were obtained 
through untargeted metabolomics detection. Possible 
biomarkers for CHD occurrence or development were 
screened. We also explored the possible mechanisms for 
differential metabolites in the occurrence of CHD. Our 
results provide basic data resources into congenital heart 
disease from a new perspective.
Congenital heart disease is one of the most common 
birth defects [1], and the diagnosis of the disease is overly 
dependent on the technical level of ultrasonography [5].
Metabolomics is an extension of genomics that can 
more intuitively reflect the profiling of metabolites in 
biofluids, cells and tissues and it is routinely applied as 
a tool for biomarker discovery [27]. Owing to innovative 
developments in informatics and analytical technologies 
and the integration of orthogonal biological approaches, 
it has become possible to expand metabolomic analyses 
to understand the systems-level effects of metabolites, 
which can be used for CHD screening or to explore the 
mechanism of occurrence and development of CHD.

A previousstudy conducted a serum metabolomics 
study on children with congenital heart disease and 
found that 13 metabolites showed a significant increasing 
or decreasing trend. Taurine, glutamine, and glutamate 
presented considerable diagnostic value for the diagno -
sis of CHD [16]. Some researchers performed metabo -
lomics detection on the serum of patients with congenital 
bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and controls [15]. A predic -
tive model for estimating group BAV was established and 
those studies supported the value of serum-based metab -
olomic profiling methods as an adjunct tool for screening 
large populations.
However, these studies used infant or childhood serum 
samples as material to explore the relationship between metabolites and CHD, and it is relatively rare to study the 
occurrence of CHD through biological samples obtained 
from pregnant mothers. Previous studies reported 
that maternal serum [17], urine [18, 19], and amniotic 
fluid (AF) [20] were used to detect metabolites by [1] H 
NMR or GC–MS technology. However, these methods 
for detecting metabolites are more limited than those 
detected by UHPLC‒MS.
Amniotic fluid, as the growing environment of the 
fetus, is relatively stable in the middle and late pregnancy 
stages. Compared with maternal blood, urine and other 
samples, it can better reflect the actual metabolic state of 
the fetus. The urine excreted by the fetus after the sec -
ond trimester is an important source of amniotic fluid,

and the metabolites in the fetus will be reflected in the 
amniotic fluid with the excretion of urine. The sources of 
amniotic fluid in the second and third trimesters are basi -
cally similar. Amniotic fluid not only provides a mechani -
cal buffer for the fetus to prevent limb adhesion but also 
provides nutrients and growth factors, transports metab -
olites, and more. At the same time, the physiological and 
biochemical levels of the amniotic fluid reflect the health 
status of the fetus. Accurate and sensitive details of birth 
defect-related metabolites and their respective biochemi -
cal pathways can be obtained through amniotic fluid 
metabolomics, which also allows a better understanding 
of the overall pathophysiology of affected pregnancies.
A total of 2472 metabolites were identified using the 
UHPLC-QTOF-MS untargeted metabolomics detection in this study. Many new metabolites were found com -
pared to previous studies, which mostly used NMR or 
GC-TOF–MS methods, and could only detect hundreds 
of metabolites [17–20]. UHPLC is increasingly displac -
ing conventional high performance liquid chromatogra -
phy [28] LC–MS is the main workhorse of metabolomics 
owing to its high degree of analytical sensitivity and 
specificity when measuring diverse chemistry in complex 
biological samples [29]. The untargeted metabolomics 
detection method can identify as many metabolites as 
possible by comparing characteristic peak ions with 
standard databases, and useing semiquantitative metab -
olite content to obtain high-throughput metabolomics 
data [ 28]. Untargeted metabolomics is a powerful tool 
that can provide new clues for prenatal diagnosis [14]

。It will be helpful for discovering affected metabolic 
pathways, revealing disease pathogenesis, and identifying 
potential biomarkers [27].
The method of combining the fold change, the P value 
of the t-test and the VIP value of the OPLS-DA model 
was utilized to screen the differential metabolites, 
and the machine algorithm of randomForest (RF) was 
exploited to screen the biomarkers. The randomForest is 
an ensemble learning method that operates by construct -
ing a collection of decision trees [30], and for variable 
selection, it performs well across sample sizes [31]. In 
addition, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) 
score and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each 
selected marker. We also evaluated the combined differ -
entuation ability of these makers using a logistic regres -
sion model. The results show that PE(MonoMe(11,5)/

in maternal amniotic fluid perform well in distinguishing 
cases from controls.
PE(MonoMe(11,5)/MonoMe(13,5)), also called 
13-(3-methyl-5-pentylfuran-2-yl) tridecanoate, a kind 
of dimethylfuran fatty acid, is abundant in fish oil and is 
easily oxidized and degraded [32]. There are few reports 
about this chemical, but it has been found to be decreased 
in patients with gastrointestinal diseases [33]. 4-[N-(p-
Coumaroyl)serotonin-4’’-yl]-N-feruloylserotonin is a 
serotonin derivative with a trace distribution in medici -
nal plants such as safflower [23]. It has strong scavenging 
free radicals and anti-lipid peroxidation ability, antitumor 
activity, anti-inflammatory and bacteriostatic effects, and it inhibits the production of melanin and other functional 
activities. This substance has the potential for the study 
of atherosclerosis and aortic wall distention [24]. 2,6-Di-
tert-butylbenzoquinone, a cyclic NIAS originating from 
food packaging, has not been found to be associated 
with disease occurrence. However, a similar substance 
2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone, is a revers -
ible inhibitor of cardiac cells through intracellular  Ca2+ 
handling in ventricular myocytes [34]. Among the ten 
most important metabolites, methylglutarylcarnitine was 
also reported detected differentially in CHD patients and 
controls [17]. Deficiency of 3- methylglutarylcarnitine 
affects the metabolism of leucine as well as ketogenesis. 
This disorder is one of an increasing list of inborn errors 
of metabolism that present clinically, such as metabolic 
syndrome (MetS), risk of developing cardiovascular dis -
ease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes [35].
This study found that the differential metabolites were 
mainly concentrated in several metabolic pathways, and 
it was inferred that aldosterone synthesis, drug metabo -
lism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism played 
very important roles in the occurrence and develop -
ment of CHD. The secretion of aldosterone is mainly 
regulated by renin-angiotensin, a hormone that regu -
lates the blood volume in the human body. It maintains 
water balance by regulating the reabsorption of sodium 
in kidneys. Excessive circulating and tissue angiotensin II 
(AngII) and aldosterone levels lead to a profibrotic, pro -
inflammatory, and hypertrophic milieu [36] that causes 
remodeling and dysfunction of cardiovascular and renal 
tissues [37]. Nicotinate and nicotinamide are collectively 
referred to as vitamin 22. Nicotinamide forms coenzyme

I and coenzyme II with ribose, phosphate and adenine in 
the body. They are the coenzymes of many dehydroge -
nases and are associated with many metabolic processes 
including glucose glycolysis, fat metabolism, and pyru -
vate metabolism, which are closely related to the forma -
tion of high-energy phosphate bonds [38]. As the major 
coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phospho -
rylation and a substrate for enzyme responses to energy 
stress and oxidative stress, nicotinamide adenine dinu -
cleotide (NAD +) is emerging as a metabolic target in a 
number of diseases including heart failure. Niacin turns 
into niacinamide in the body to play the above role. In 
addition, niacin also has a strong peripheral vasodilator 
effect. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is syn -
thesized de novo from tryptophan through the kynure -
nine pathway. The patients showed treduced levels of 
circulating NAD. Defects similar to those in the patients 
developed in the embryos of Haao-null or Kynu-null 
mice owing to NAD deficiency. The prevention of NAD 
deficiency during gestation could prevent these defects 
[39]. These results would provide additional new metabo -
lite data sources for the CHD, and suggest a new idea for 
further mechanistic exploration of CHD.
Of course, this study also has some shortcomings: the 
sample size is relatively small, and the metabolite dif -
ferences between CHD subtypes could not be analyzed 
comparatively. The basic characteristics the of cases 
and controls are somewhat inconsistent due to the lim -
ited collection of samples in biobanks, which may inter -
fere with the results. In addition, only internal data were 
used in the validation model, and no external database 
was used for verification. Future studies should focus on 
larger sample sizes for in-depth analysis and validation. 
This study will provide certain directions and ideas for 
future studies.

Resource

BACKGROUND: The clinical use of common cardiac
biomarkers, such as brain natriuretic peptides and
troponins, has traditionally been limited to adult
populations in the assessment of heart failure and acutecoronary syndrome, respectively. While many have dis-counted the value of these markers in pediatric popula-tions, emerging evidence suggests they may be useful inthe diagnosis and prognostication of many cardiac andnoncardiac pathologies in neonates, children, and ado-
lescents, and an increasing number of pediatric hospitals
are routinely measuring cardiac markers in their clinicalpractice.
CONTENT: This review summarizes and critically
evaluates the current literature regarding the applica-tion of cardiac biomarkers for clinical decision-makingin the pediatric population. Main potential clinicalindications discussed herein include primary cardiacdisease, immune-related conditions, and noncardiac
disease. Important diagnostic and interpretative chal-
lenges are also described in relation to each potentialindication.
SUMMARY: Despite a general lack of clinical awareness
regarding the value of cardiac biomarkers in pediat-rics, there is increasing literature to support theirapplication in various contexts. Cardiac biomarkersshould be considered an undervalued resource in thepediatric population with potential value in the diag-
nosis and prognosis of myocarditis, congenital heart
disease, and heart failure, as well as in the assessmentof severity and cardiac involvement in immune-related and other systemic conditions. While interpre-tation remains challenging in pediatrics due to theage- and sex-speciﬁc dynamics occurring throughout
growth and development, this should not prevent
their application. Future research should focus ondeﬁning evidence-based cut-offs for speciﬁc indica-
tions using the most up-to-date assays.
Introduction
Circulating cardiac biomarkers are integral to the diag-
nosis, prognosis, and monitoring of cardiac distress in
patients with both primary and nonprimary cardiac eti-
ology. The most commonly used cardiac biomarkers in
clinical care are B-type natriuretic peptides (i.e., B-type
natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal fragment
prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP))
and cardiac troponins (cTns). Indeed, the advent ofhigh sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn), BNP, and NT-proBNP
assay measurements has revolutionized the management
of cardiac disease in adults, providing particular value in
the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and
heart failure (HF), respectively, and their differentiation
from other conditions with similar clinical presenta-
tions. Additional cardiac biomarkers that are similarlyuseful in the identification of myocardial injury or HF
in adults, but often not available clinically, include
creatine kinase MB isoform (CK-MB), myoglobin, solu-
ble interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (ST2), galectin 3, and
heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP).
Despite clear applications in adult populations, the clini-
cal value of cardiac biomarkers in pediatrics is not wellunderstood. Importantly, the clinical presentation and
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying common
cardiac stressors in children are quite discrepant from
adults. For example, the most common clinical indica-
tion for measuring cTns in adults is suspicion of myo-
cardial infarction (MI). Due to the extreme rarity of
pediatric MI, the clinical value of cTns in children hasoften been discounted. However, existent and emerging
literature points toward different, but perhaps equally
valuable, indications for these biomarkers in neonates,
children, and adolescents relative to adults. Here, we
critically review the current literature investigating
potential clinical applications for cardiac biomarker
measurement in pediatric populations and discusspossible implications for clinical decision-making and
patient care.

Pediatric Considerations
Proper use and interpretation of cardiac biomarkers in a
pediatric context require special consideration, as well as
a basic understanding of their physiological role, analyti-
cal limitations, and underlying concentration pattern
throughout childhood and adolescence ( Fig. 1 ).
CARDIAC TROPONINS
Tropomyosin protein contains complexes composed of
cardiac troponin C (cTnC), cardiac troponin I (cTnI),
and cardiac troponin T (cTnT). In healthy individuals,most cTn is bound to the sarcomere with the remainder
existing freely in the cytoplasm within cardiac myocytes.
In adults, both cTnI and cTnT are of diagnosticand clinical value in the identification of myocardial
injury. The clinical and analytical considerations
associated with cTnI and cTnT measurement in this
context, including assay sensitivity, commutability,and interpretation, have been extensively reviewed
elsewhere ( 3). In brief, the Fourth Universal
Definition of MI defines acute myocardial injury as ris-ing or falling patterns in cTn values with at least onevalue above the assay-specific 99th percentile ( 4).
While cTn values increase under ischemic conditionsas a reflection of myocardial injury, the underlyingpathophysiological mechanism (e.g., preload-inducedmechanical stretch, myocardial cell turnover, and apo-ptosis) cannot be definitively concluded. An importantcaveat to the specificity of cTns in the identification ofmyocardial injury in adults is re-expression of cTnT ininjured skeletal muscle, causing false-positive cardiacdiagnoses ( 4). This has not been reported to date for
cTnI ( 4). An appreciation of this is important in the
interpretation of increases in cTn in both adults andchildren.
Evaluating cTns in pediatrics presents unique
challenges that are often overlooked in available adult-
focused literature. The International Federation for

Committee on Clinical Applications of Cardiac Bio-Markers (C-CB) has developed definitive tables of 99th
percentiles for the majority of high-sensitivity, contem-
porary, and point-of-care cTn assays ( Table 1 )(10).
Unfortunately, these manufacturer-derived percentile
cut-offs are based exclusively on adult populations. In
the limited literature available, cTnI and cTnT concen-trations in healthy children and adolescents have beenreported to differ slightly as compared to adults, with
some reports indicating slight increases, particularly in
the neonatal period ( Table 1 )(1,2,9,11). These rela-
tive increases could be a result of cTn release from cardi-
omyocytes due to physiological growth ( 1,2,9,11).
While the mechanism behind increased neonatal cTnconcentrations is unknown, fetal cTn expression in theskeletal muscle, transient hypoxia at birth, and/or car-
diac leakage are proposed to contribute to increased con-
centrations ( 12). These concentration dynamics suggest
age-specific interpretation may be required within the
pediatric population. Age-specific dynamics in cTn have
also been observed in adults, with higher concentrationsreported in the elderly. Considering age in cTn interpre-tation is thought to add significant clinical complexity
with unknown improvements on clinical outcome.
However, in pediatrics, it is clear that cTn interpretationin neonates requires age-specific interpretation ( Fig. 1 ).
Minor sex-specific differences in cTn have also
been observed in healthy adolescents, with higher con-
centrations in males relative to females ( 1). This obser-
vation is consistent with adult findings, although the
endorsement of sex-specific 99th percentiles for cTns in
the assessment of MI is not consistent across adult-basedclinical guidelines ( 4,13). Based on available evidence,
sex-specific 99th percentiles are strongly encouraged by
the laboratory community ( 13). Taken together, these
considerations underscore the potential importance ofinterpreting cTnI and cTnT concentrations in an age-
and sex-specific manner. More large-scale studies are
needed to support whether age and sex-stratification isof clinical value. In addition to considering age/sex, dif-
ferences between the clinical utility of cTnI and cTnT
are not well understood, especially in pediatrics. This ev-idence gap combined with lack of standardization incTn assays poses clinical challenges and complicates the
comparison and interpretation of research study find-
ings, particularly in pediatrics where literature is morelimited. In this review, findings from conventional and
high sensitivity assays will be notated as cTn in ng/mL
and hs-cTn in ng/L, respectively. The isoform of cTn(i.e., cTnT, cTnI) will be specified.
B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES
BNPs are released primarily from the cardiac ventriclesin response to pressure overload and ventricular wallstretch. The prohormone, proBNP, is released and sub-
sequently cleaved to produce the active hormone, BNP,and an inactive N-terminal fragment, NT-proBNP.
Similar to cTn, BNP and NT-proBNP interpretation in
children is complicated by unique age and sex dynamics.Pediatric reference concentrations of BNP and NT-
proBNP have been reported to be significantly increased
at birth, decreasing rapidly during the first few weeks oflife, after which concentrations remain largely stable ( 6,
14,15). The increased concentration at birth is sus-
pected to be a result of perinatal circulatory changescausing increased ventricular volume and pressure ( 16).
Following the neonatal period, there is a decline in BNP
and NT-proBNP concentrations. Some studies have ob-
served slight increases in puberty, suggesting modula-tion of cardiac natriuretic peptides by endocrine and/or
paracrine actions of sex hormones on the renin-angio-
tensin system ( 17). However, others have reported no
change in adolescence relative to early childhood ( 2).
When comparing pediatric and adult values, BNP and
NT-proBNP have been observed to be higher in chil-dren and adolescents ( Table 1 ). The mechanism behind
such physiological increases is unknown and further re-
search is needed. The influence of sex on BNP and NT-
proBNP concentrations is even less clear, and conflict-ing findings have been reported ( 14,15). Furthermore,
the clinical utility and performance of BNP and NT-
proBNP are largely regarded as comparable in manyadult guidelines, with the exception of evaluating
patients on angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors
(ARNIs) where NT-proBNP is preferred due to BNPacting as a substrate for neprilysin ( 5,18). Their relative
benefits in pediatric indications are not clear. Most stud-
ies do not provide rationale for selecting BNP vs NT-proBNP and few evaluate comparative clinical utility.Biomarker selection may be related to analytical consid-
erations; NT-proBNP is often seen as more desirable
due to its longer half-life, increased stability in vitro,and better concordance between assays compared to
BNP ( 19).
ADDITIONAL CARDIAC BIOMARKERS
While cTns, BNP, and NT-proBNP dominate clinical
practice and recent literature, other cardiac biomarkers
have demonstrated value in the identification of myocar-dial injury or HF in adults. Specifically, prior to the de-
velopment and clinical implementation of hs-cTn
assays, CK-MB and myoglobin were primarily used forthe identification of MI in adults. Given the improved
sensitivity and specificity of cTns relative to CK-MB
and myoglobin, The Fourth Universal Definition of MIonly recommends their measurement when cTn is notavailable ( 4). This has led many clinical laboratories to
stop offering these assays. Thus, this review will not fo-
cus on their application in pediatrics.Cardiac Biomarkers in PediatricsReview

4 Clinical Chemistry 00:0 (2021) In addition to markers of myocardial injury, ST2,
galectin-3, and H-FABP have demonstrated value in
the prognostication of HF in adults. In contrast to
CK-MB and myoglobin, these markers are relativelynovel and often not available on routine analyzers, re-quiring specialized assay methodologies (e.g., ELISA),
leading to lack of clinical implementation. Guidelines
on the classification of HF in adults do not providestrong recommendations on the clinical application ofthese markers ( 5,18). Unsurprisingly, their role in pe-
diatrics is even less clear with very few publications
reporting clinical and normative data. Thus, these car-diac biomarkers will not be a focus in this review, butshould be revisited as more literature becomes
available.
In summary, as demonstrated in Fig. 1 , cTnI,
cTnT, BNP, and NT-proBNP concentrations vary byage and sometimes by sex, requiring consideration ofthese covariates in pediatric test interpretation. An ap-
preciation of this, along with analytical and biochemical
differences, is important to keep in mind in test applica-tion and interpretation in children and adolescents.Potential clinical indications for cardiac
biomarkers in pediatrics
PRIMARY CARDIAC DISEASE
While the overall prevalence of cardiac disease in the pe-
diatric population is much lower when compared toadults, it contributes significantly to pediatric morbidity
and mortality with high disease burden. Noninvasive
biochemical monitoring may present a clinically usefulresource in pediatric cardiology, correlating to severity
of congenital heart disease, as well as various acquired
heart conditions. However, very few guidelines are avail-able to support their definitive clinical use in certaincontexts in pediatrics. A summary of literature regarding
potential indications for cardiac biomarkers in pediatric
heart diseases is described below ( Fig. 2 ).
EMERGENCY SETTINGS
The measurement of cTn in adult patients presenting to
the emergency department (ED) with chest pain is rou-
tine. In pediatrics, suspicion of MI or other underlyingcardiac pathology in patients with chest pain is low, and
Fig. 2. Summary of potential diagnostic and prognostic indications for traditional cardiac biomarkers in pediatric heart disease.
Note: cTn isoforms and BNPs are not differentiated due to insufﬁcient literature to support a clinical advantage of measuring
one versus the other.Cardiac Biomarkers in PediatricsReview
Clinical Chemistry 00:0 (2021) 5 thus the utility of cTn in this scenario is heavily
debated. Few retrospective studies have suggested thatboth cTnI and cTnT can be useful adjuncts in the dif-
ferentiation of cardiac involvement in these patients
(20–23). In a recent study by Dionne et al., increased
cTnT ( /C210.1 ng/mL) was observed in 9% of the study
population (0 to <20 years, ED patients) and a cardiac
diagnosis was made in 60% of those patients ( 20). The
most common cardiac diagnoses observed included
myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia ( 20), sim-
ilar to other reports ( 21–23). Serial cTn measurement
was not reported as useful when cTn concentrationswere increased at presentation, but was suggested to be
of potential value when initial concentrations are not
increased and there is ongoing concern about cardiacinvolvement ( 20). Other reports did not specifically
evaluate the impact of serial testing, but discussed po-
tential value in trending cTn values ( 21–23). These
findings suggest that while there is very low likelihood
of MI in the pediatric population, cTn screening in chil-
dren presenting with chest pain may be useful in theidentification of underlying cardiac etiology, especiallyin the presence of clinical suspicion or abnormal electro-
cardiogram. It is important to note there are no clinical
recommendations supporting the measurement ofcTn in children presenting with nonspecific chest pain.
Indeed, many argue cTn screening provides minimal
benefit in relation to its associated costs and resourceutilization ( 24). Prospective cohort studies are needed to
weigh the benefits of cTn screening in pediatric EDs
using the most up-to-date high sensitivity assays andstandardized serial testing algorithms.
MYOCARDITIS
Myocarditis, an inflammatory disease of the heart mus-cle, remains a diagnostic and prognostic challenge in the
pediatric population. Cardiac biomarkers, in conjunc-
tion with imaging and endomyocardial biopsy, may aidin both the diagnosis and prognosis of myocarditis in
children. Specifically, cTn measurement has been sug-
gested to have clinical value in the exclusion of myocar-ditis in children, and several diagnostic cut-offs havebeen proposed. cTnT diagnostic cut-offs of <0.052 ng/
mL (sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 86%) ( 25) and
<0.01 ng/mL (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 85%) ( 26)
have been reported. In both reports, statistics are based
on a single screening test, providing limited information
on the value of reassessment ( 25,26). Recently,
Howard et al. used pediatric ED data to assess the
appropriateness of these cut-offs ( 27). As part of their
diagnostic algorithm for myocarditis, the authors foundthat a cTnT cut-off of 0.01 ng/mL was more sensitive asa single screening test and did not significantly compro-
mise specificity. These proposed cut-offs are much lower
than those commonly used to identify myocarditis inadults ( >0.1 ng/mL). This could suggest that clinical
outcomes are associated with smaller relative increases incTn concentrations in pediatric populations, further
highlighting the need for special considerations in
children. In addition to cTnT, significant increases incTnI have been described in pediatric patients with
myocarditis relative to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopa-
thy, suggesting value in the differential diagnosis ofthese conditions ( 28). BNP has not demonstrated simi-
lar differential capacity, with generally poor diagnostic
value ( 28). Literature regarding NT-proBNP measure-
ment in pediatric myocarditis diagnosis is very limited.
In addition to the diagnosis of myocarditis in
children, current evidence supports the value of cardiac
biomarkers in patient prognosis. Markers of cardiac in-
jury, such as creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and/orcTn, have been shown to correlate with poor clinical
outcomes in children with myocarditis, including
the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) support and higher risk of mortality ( 29,30).
NT-proBNP and BNP also have demonstrated value in
the prediction of low left ventricular ejection fraction,
need for mechanical circulatory support, and risk ofcardiac arrest in children with myocarditis ( 31,32).
Thus, monitoring various cardiac biomarkers may pro-
vide both diagnostic and prognostic value in the settingof pediatric myocarditis, particularly given existing chal-lenges in rapid patient identification.
CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common
form of congenital anomaly worldwide, with complex
CHDs representing the most severe form of illness. Theclinical utility of cardiac biomarkers in the context ofCHD relates mainly to prognosis, although BNP has
been proposed as a neonatal screening tool for the iden-
tification of CHD ( 33). Focusing on prognosis, CHDs
are commonly associated with anatomical abnormalities,
volume and pressure overload, cyanosis, and pulmonary
hypertension (PH). These pathophysiological stressorscan result in myocardial damage due to the exertion ofdirect pressure and stretching of myocardial cells. Thus,
there is an anticipated role for markers of cardiac injury
in assessing the extent of myocardial damage in pediatricpatients with CHD. Indeed, increases in hs-cTnI have
been observed in children with atrial septal defects
(ASDs) and to a greater extent in ventricular septaldefects (VSDs) as a potential indicator of silent myocar-dial damage ( 34). Stratification of pediatric CHD
patients based on hs-cTnT increases ( >14 ng/L) has
also been shown to predict higher incidence of cardio-vascular events upon hospital admission ( 35). Markers
of cardiac injury thus should be considered when assess-
ing myocardial damage and prognosis in pediatricpatients with CHD.Review
6 Clinical Chemistry 00:0 (2021) Another important consideration in the prognosis
of pediatric patients with CHD is the identification ofPH and/or HF. PH is characterized by increased bloodpressure combined with arterial resistance in the pulmo-nary vasculature. NT-proBNP, BNP, cTnI, and cTnThave all been shown to correlate with measures of PH inpediatric CHD patients, suggesting they may be usefulin the differentiation of CHD patients with and without
PH ( 36). In addition, both BNP and NT-proBNP have
demonstrated clinical value in the diagnosis of HF inpatients with CHD, as discussed in detail below.
CARDIAC SURGERY
Predicting postoperative outcomes in pediatric cardiacsurgery is key in reducing adverse events, hospital stays,and the need for reoperation. The value of cTns in post-operative evaluation, particularly in neonatal and pediat-ric CHD patients, is well appreciated in the literature(37–41). Indeed, a formative prospective study
by Immer et al. showed that cTnI concentrations>25 ng/mL in children at 4 h and >35 ng/mL at 24 h
after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) postsur-
gery, reliably predicted the need for increased inotropic
support, renal dysfunction, and duration of intubation(41). The validity of these findings is supported by
more recent studies evaluating persistent postoperativepediatric cTn increases, indicating value in assessing riskof mortality as well as low cardiac output syndrome(37–40). There is conflicting evidence to suggest that
other cardiac markers, such as BNP, possess similar clin-ical utility ( 40). High pediatric preoperative concentra-
tions of BNP have been shown to be an independent
predictor of prolonged ICU stay ( 38). Conversely, the
use of BNP as a prognostic marker for readmission andmortality in children was refuted by both Gupta et al.and Parker et al. ( 42,43), suggesting further investiga-
tion is warranted.
HEART FAILURE
The clinical manifestations of HF in infants andchildren have been reported as diverse and dissimilar toadults, with primary causes relating to conditionsdiscussed above, including dilated cardiomyopathy,myocarditis, and CHD. As most pediatric patients withnew-onset HF are diagnosed late in disease pathogenesisin a state of severe decompensation, facilitating early di-agnosis and accurate prognostication through laboratorytesting is of great interest ( 44). In this regard, BNP and
NT-proBNP have demonstrated utility in identifying
HF in pediatric patients presenting with nonspecific
symptoms of respiratory and noncardiac disease. A studyby Auerbach et al. concluded that a BNP concentration>140 pg/mL in pediatric outpatients with mild-to-mod-
erately symptomatic HF can be used to identify childrenat higher risk for worse outcomes, includinghospitalization, transplantation, and death ( 45). As no-
tated in Table 1 , this cut-off is substantially higher than
that proposed to rule out HF as unlikely in adults inambulatory settings ( >50 pg/mL). Few guidelines for
the management of pediatric HF are available. TheCanadian Cardiovascular Society published a guidelineon the Presentation, Diagnosis, and Management ofHeart Failure in Children in 2013 ( 44). In this guide-
line, BNP and/or NT-proBNP measurement is stronglyrecommended in the evaluation of acute HF in children.However, unlike their corresponding adult recommen-dations, specific quantitative cut-offs are not provided.This lack of recommended quantitative cut-offs presentschallenges in the clinical implementation of this guide-line in pediatric healthcare centers and further highlightsthe lack of clinical appreciation for these markers inpediatrics.
In summary, there is evidence suggesting advantage
of the application of cardiac biomarkers in the assess-ment of pediatric heart conditions, especially in myocar-ditis, CHD, cardiac surgery, and HF ( Fig. 2 ). However,
despite available literature, there is limited clinicalguidance to support the routine measurement of theseparameters in children and adolescents with primaryheart conditions. Future work should focus on more ex-tensive outcome studies in pediatrics using up-to-dateanalytical assays in a prospective fashion.
Infectious, autoimmune, & rheumatic disease. The litera-
ture regarding the clinical utility of cardiac biomarkerassessment in pediatric patients is not limited to evaluat-ing primary cardiac disease. Indeed, some studiessuggest utility in prognosis and monitoring of severalimmune-related conditions with secondary cardiac man-ifestations, including infectious, autoimmune, andrheumatic disease, as reviewed below and presented inFig. 3 .
SEPSIS & SEPTIC SHOCK
The underlying immunopathology of various infectious
diseases can result in cardiac dysfunction in severe cases.Current literature supports the measurement of cardiacbiomarkers to assist in patient risk assessment and out-come prediction in various infectious diseases in chil-dren, particularly sepsis. Studies have shown that cTnIand BNP concentrations measured upon hospital ad-mission are associated with myocardial dysfunctionamong septic pediatric patients ( 46,47). These cardiac
biomarkers have also been indicated as useful prognosticmeasures in the assessment of sepsis severity. In aprospective observational study, Fenton et al. observedincreased cTnI ( >0.1 ng/mL) in more than 50% of chil-
dren with septic shock upon hospital admission, whichwas associated with severity of illness ( 48). More re-
cently, Zhang et al. reported cTnI and BNP measuredCardiac Biomarkers in PediatricsReview
Clinical Chemistry 00:0 (2021) 7 one day after admission were significantly associated
with the severity of sepsis in 120 pediatric patients ( 49).
Compared to children with sepsis, Wu et al. observedsignificantly higher BNP concentrations in childrenwith septic shock, as well as among nonsurvivors relativeto survivors ( 47). NT-proBNP concentrations have also
been shown to be useful in differentiating HF in chil-dren with sepsis, as well as in predicting in-hospitalmortality ( 50,51). The mechanisms behind increases in
cTns and BNPs in septic neonatal and pediatric patientsremain unclear, although many groups postulate directinflammatory injury to myocytes results in cardiomyo-cyte necrosis, leading to increased cTn concentrations.Increased BNP concentrations may also be attributed toseverity of illness, including extent of inflammation andrenal damage, rather than underlying cardiomyopathy.
RHEUMATIC DISEASE
Cardiac involvement in pediatric onset rheumatic dis-eases has prompted investigation into the clinical utilityof cardiac biomarkers in patient assessment. Specifically,acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a major cause of HF inchildren and continues to be an important public
health concern, particularly in developing countries. It is
estimated that approximately 60% of ARF patients de-velop rheumatic carditis, progressing to rheumatic heart
disease and constituting the main cause of morbidity
and mortality ( 52). Despite known cardiac involvement
in ARF, several studies investigating the concentrations
of prominent cardiac injury markers such as cTnI,
cTnT, and CK-MB in pediatric patients with rheumatic
carditis compared to ARF patients without active cardi-
tis (53–55), patients with scarlet fever ( 55), and healthy
control children ( 56) have found no clinically significant
differences. However, Ozdemir et al. did report a slight
statistically significant increase in cTnT concentrationsin 28 pediatric patients with ARF active carditis in com-
parison to 32 healthy control children, although this
observed increase did not surpass reported normal limits
(57). It is speculated that this lack of prominent change,
specifically in cTnI and cTnT concentrations, suggestsrheumatic carditis results from connective tissue involve-
ment leading to valve malfunction, rather than direct
myocyte damage ( 54,55). Conversely, NT-proBNP
Fig. 3. Summary of potential diagnostic and prognostic indications for cardiac biomarkers in noncardiac conditions in children
and adolescents.Review
8 Clinical Chemistry 00:0 (2021) concentrations have been reported to be significantly
increased in children with rheumatic carditis compared
both to children with quiescent rheumatic heart disease
(58) and healthy control children ( 58–60). Therefore,
while cTnI, cTnT, and CK-MB concentrations likely
have limited value in the diagnosis or prognosis of rheu-
matic carditis in children, NT-proBNP could present a
useful adjunct in this regard.
KAWASAKI DISEASE
Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitisthat primarily affects children under 5 years of age and
is considered by many to be the most prominent cause
of pediatric acquired heart disease. Currently, the diag-
nosis of KD is based on the presentation of clinicalfeatures and lacks a specific diagnostic biomarker.
However, several studies have reported significantly
increased concentrations of NT-proBNP in infants
and children diagnosed with KD compared to febrile
controls, as reviewed elsewhere ( 61). Following an early
prospective study by Dahdah and colleagues, which
concluded NT-proBNP to be a better marker of KD
compared to BNP, particularly in incomplete cases,
the majority of research in this field has focused on
NT-proBNP ( 62).
Importantly, NT-proBNP has been suggested to
play a role in supporting the diagnosis of KD, even in
the hyper-acute stage of disease when fever has not beenpresent long enough for a definitive diagnosis based on
clinical criteria alone ( 63). Moreover, some studies have
proposed NT-proBNP may be of clinical value in the
identification of KD patients at risk for developing coro-
nary artery lesions ( 64,65) or progression to KD Shock
Syndrome ( 66). Despite promising findings, many
researchers stress that NT-proBNP is insufficient to be
used as a stand-alone test in the diagnosis of KD. NT-
proBNP testing is also not supported in the American
Heart Association clinical diagnostic guidelines for KD,as it may not be sufficient to differentiate KD, and clear
cut-off points have not yet been defined ( 67). Research
investigating other prominent cardiac biomarkers in KD
diagnosis and prognosis are conflicting and do not yet
support routine use in clinical practice.
It is also important to note that cardiac biomarkers
may assist in the identification and assessment of pediat-
ric patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in
children (MIS-C), the novel hyperinflammatory condi-
tion with KD-like features associated with coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Cardiovascular involvementin patients with MIS-C has been reported as common.
Indeed, a recent US study of 185 MIS-C patients
reported 73% and 50% of patients presented with in-
creased BNP and cTn concentrations, respectively ( 68).
The clinical utility of these markers in the assessment ofthis novel condition should continue to be evaluated as
new data emerge.
Other indications. Similar to the immune-related diseases
described above, many pathophysiological conditions
originating from other organs can ultimately lead to
cardiac distress. Thus, cardiac biomarkers have been in-vestigated in the prognostication of various noncardiac
conditions ( Fig. 3 ). Specifically, hypoxemia-related
myocardial dysfunction is estimated to occur in approxi-
mately 30% of neonates, with increased incidence in
preterm infants. Increases in cTns are estimated to beuseful in evaluating the severity of myocardial damage
and outcome in perinatal asphyxia ( 69). In addition,
myocardial stress is common in children with chronickidney disease (CKD). Although renal transplantation
may improve the cardiac damage associated with CKD,
it possesses its own cardiac risks requiring monitoring.
The assessment of NT-proBNP to identify cardiac strain
in patients with compromised renal function can bechallenging, due to its physiological clearance by the
kidney. However, studies have demonstrated good
correlations between NT-proBNP concentrations and
reliable echocardiographic markers of cardiac strain, sug-
gesting it could be a useful adjunct in assessing pediatricpatients with renal insufficiency ( 70).
An additional application for pediatric cardiac
biomarkers is their use in monitoring cardiotoxicity in
pediatric patients after cancer treatment. Anticancerdrugs, particularly anthracyclines, can elicit cardiotoxic
effects in pediatric cancer patients and lead to irrevers-
ible cardiovascular damage, as well as cardiovascular
disease ( 71). BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations
have shown to be increased in childhood cancer patientspost-treatment with anthracyclines, compared to con-
centrations pretreatment or in healthy controls, suggest-
ing cardiotoxic effects ( 72). The risk of developing
acute, but not late-onset, anthracycline-related left ven-
tricular dysfunction has been indicated by an increase in
BNP or NT-proBNP; however, sensitivity is poor ( 72).
More evidence is required to determine the accuracy
of cTnI and cTnT as a marker for cardiotoxicity and
resulting cardiac damage in children.
One final consideration of importance in the
interpretation of pediatric cardiac biomarkers is their
evaluation in musculoskeletal disorders. Increases incTnT have been observed in pediatric patients with
skeletal muscle damage, including Pompe disease, with
no evidence of cardiac etiology ( 73). It is estimated that
cTnT is re-expressed in skeletal muscle tissue in these
cases, causing a potentially false “cardiac positive” inter-pretation ( 73). It is important to take this into consider-
ation when evaluating children with musculoskeletalCardiac Biomarkers in PediatricsReview
Clinical Chemistry 00:0 (2021) 9 disorders and avoid unnecessary cardiac testing and
interventions ( 73).
Future Directions: At the Heart of the Matter
This critical review summarizes potential clinical indica-
tions for cardiac biomarkers in pediatrics, which arepredominantly ordered in adults. While the use of thesebiomarkers is often discounted in pediatric practice,current literature suggests a multitude of possible appli-cations in both cardiac and noncardiac conditions.However, it is important to note that the interpretationand comparison of available literature is complicated bythe use of different analytical methodologies and studypopulations. Very few studies examine both BNP andNT-proBNP as well as cTnI and cTnT, as most litera-ture is retrospective and based on the assays in clinicaluse at that institution. Thus, the advantages of selecting
cTnI vs cTnT or BNP vs NT-proBNP in certain clinical
indications is difficult to ascertain. Additionally, manystudies use manufacturer-derived cut-offs, which arebased exclusively on adults, to define increases in thesebiomarkers. Indeed, the assessment of these markers inchildren and adolescents is complicated by physiologicalchanges of these markers with age or sex, necessitatingthe development and use of multiple age- and/or sex-stratified cut-off values. This is particularly true forneonates wherein increased concentrations are physio-logically prevalent and unique applications are possible.
Despite these interpretive limitations, current litera-
ture suggests that cardiac biomarkers have potential utilityin the diagnosis and prognosis of myocarditis, CHD, car-diac surgery, and HF, as well as the assessment of severityand cardiac involvement in immune-related and other sys-temic conditions. However, the majority of data discussedin this review reports correlations between increased car-diac biomarkers and clinical outcome based on retrospec-tive chart review. There is a critical evidence gap inprospective studies demonstrating the specific functional-ity of these biomarkers in preventing unnecessary hospital-ization and medical intervention and/or improving timeto appropriate treatment and clinical outcome. While
these studies are challenging to complete in the pediatric
population, particularly given low patient incidence, theyare urgently needed to support evidence-based guidelinesand appropriate clinical implementation of select cardiacbiomarkers in the assessment of both cardiac and noncar-diac conditions.
Further, in addition to knowing when to order
these tests, another important question that remains tobe answered is how often they should be ordered. In the
context of diagnosis, rising and falling values of cTn inED assessment of adult MI is paramount. Exactly howthis translates to pediatric practice is unclear, particularlyas underlying pathophysiological stressors causingincreased cTn in children presenting to the ED are
vastly different from those in adults. Although some lit-
erature has suggested retesting in acute settings when ini-
tial concentrations of cTn are not increased ( 20), there is
no consensus. Unlike cTn, serial measurements of BNP
or NT-proBNP to reduce hospitalizations or mortality in
the context of adult HF are not recommended due to in-
sufficient data. Unsurprisingly, the value of serial BNP or
NT-proBNP measurement in children and adolescents is
even less clear. Without this information, it is difficult to
provide guidance to clinicians on proper utilization ofthese tests in pediatrics, warranting further prospective
study.
In conclusion, this review provides novel perspec-
tive and raises important considerations for the increas-
ing application of cardiac biomarkers in neonates,children, and adolescents, highlighting a population that
is often overlooked in cardiac biomarker research. While
it is clear cardiac biomarkers have potential value in the
assessment of several conditions with cardiac and non-
cardiac etiology, additional research is urgently needed
to establish evidence-based cut-offs and usage guidelines
in different clinical contexts to optimize utilization andstandardize interpretation of cardiac biomarkers in chil-
dren and adolescents.

Biomarkers in Care of Congenital 
Heart Disease Patients in the Intensive Care Unit
MELANIE NIES, MD; ALLEN EVERETT, MD
Pediatric congenital heart disease (CHD), as a heterogeneous 
group of rare individual diseases, with myriad anatomic variations and complicated medical and surgical management, 
is a prime target for biomarker discovery and applicability in perioperative patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is worthwhile for those involved in critical care management of patients to be familiar with common and promising biomarkers for CHD. This chapter will review the definition of a biomarker; describe challenges to discovery and validation of biomarkers in pediatric medicine; current biomarker use in CHD in the ICU; specific ICU situations, including nonsurgical and surgical care of patients with CHD and acquired pediatric heart disease in the ICU; and conclude with a literature review of biomarkers in critical care of patients with CHD.
The term biomarkers has a broad definition as “characteristics 
that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to therapeutic intervention.”
1 For the purposes of this chapter 
we will use the term biomarker to refer to a protein and/or small 
molecule measured in a body fluid. As methods of discovery have become increasingly sophisticated, novel biomarkers are appearing with seemingly endless potential for clinical applicability. However, validation of biomarkers for everyday use in CHD is difficult. Barriers to development and validation of biomarkers include the difficulty in development of reliable, reproducible, clinically available assays; normative values in pediatrics, and developmental regulation. Biomarker discovery and validation, with the ultimate goal of creation of a high-quality assay that meets US regulatory approval, is a complex endeavor, with only the end product visible to the clinical practitioner ordering the test at the bedside.
2 From 
procuring pediatric patient samples and winnowing down long lists of biologically feasible proteins to finally developing and validating reliable bedside assays on large cohorts, the process can take years  
(Fig. 38.1)
Despite the complexities of validation, biomarkers enticingly 
offer enormous potential for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring. Currently the vast majority of research and practical experience on biomarkers in CHD is centered on two classes of biomarkers: (1) cardiac function/failure and (2) cardiac injury.Cardiac Function/Failure Biomarkers
Cardiac function/failure biomarkers fall into two broad categories: (1) biomarkers of atrial/ventricular stretch (natriuretic peptides [NPs]) and (2) indicators of myocardial fibrosis and function, suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2), and galectin-3 (Gal3). Each of these biomarkers is discussed in detail in the following sections with emphasis placed on use in the ICU.
Natriuretic Peptides
The three natriuretic peptides (NPs) include atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and natriuretic peptide C. BNP , although also contained in the brain, is predominantly secreted by cardiac ventricular myocytes as a means of physiologic adaptation to wall stress or volume overload. The NPs are almost exclusively cardiac expressed. They each contain a common 17–amino acid ring that is essential for binding to their cognate guanylyl cyclase receptors. NPs stimulate natriuresis and diuresis by attenuat -
ing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and relaxing pulmonary vasculature by elevation of cyclic guanine monophosphate (Fig.  
38.2) BNP is the prototype for NPs, is the only NP studied in children, and will be the focus in the next section.
Cardiac Failure Biomarker Category 1: 
Natriuretic Peptides
Brain Natriuretic Peptide Structure.  BNP is the biologically 
active cleavage product of prohormone proBNP , and NTproBNP 
is the biologically inactive N-terminal (Fig. 38.3). Plasma levels differ according to half-life; BNP has a half-life of approximately 22 minutes, whereas NTproBNP has a half-life of 1 to 2 hours, accounting for higher plasma levels of NTproBNP .
3 BNP has 
important characteristics as a biomarker of ventricular stress and dilatation, including clinical availability of point-of-care plasma assays, stability over freeze-thaw cycles,
4 and existing normative 
data for both healthy children5-10 and those with structurally normal 
but failing hearts,11 CHD,11,12 and pulmonary hypertension 
(PH).11,13 However, BNP is developmentally regulated, is affected 
by renal failure, shows wide variation between and within CHD   CHAPTER 38  Biomarkers in Care of Congenital Heart Disease Patients in the Intensive Care Uni t 481 
subsets,3,12,14 and is affected by age, gender, and pubertal stage.10 
The most notable developmental regulation is the log scale difference 
in NP levels in neonates during the physiologic transition within the first week of birth,
14 attributed to maturation of the kidney, 
decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance, and acute increase in ventricular afterload after birth. There is a generalized trend of decline after the first month; adult levels are reached around 6 years of age.

• Figure 38.2  Natriuretic peptides are peptide hormones that are syn -
thesized by the heart, brain, and other organs. The release of these 
peptides by the heart is stimulated by atrial and ventricular distention, as well as by neurohumoral stimuli, usually in response to heart failure. The main physiologic action of natriuretic peptides is to reduce arterial pressure by decreasing blood volume and systemic vascular resistance. Atrial natri -
uretic peptide (ANP) is a 28–amino acid peptide that is synthesized, stored, and released by atrial myocytes in response to atrial distention, angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation, endothelin, and sympathetic stimulation 
(beta-adrenoceptor mediated). Therefore elevated levels of ANP are found during hypervolemic states (elevated blood volume), such as occurs in heart failure. A second natriuretic peptide (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) is a 32–amino acid peptide that is synthesized largely by the ventricles (as well as in the brain, where it was first identified). BNP is released by the same mechanisms that release ANP , and it has similar physiologic actions. Aldo, Aldosterone, GFR, glomerular filtration rate. (Modified from Fig. 2:

during ultrafiltration, and decreased filling of the heart. There 
is a second peak in BNP levels reported around postoperative  
day 5.14
In a prospective study of BNP levels in CHD in 221 patients 
undergoing CT surgery, Niedner et  al.12 evaluated BNP levels in 
patients with CHD undergoing both cardiac surgery and noncardiac surgery (“surgical stress” control arm). Patients were seen at a single center from 2003 to 2005, with 103 normative controls, 13 “surgical stress” controls, and 106 CHD repairs, ranging in age from 30 weeks’ gestational age through 22 years. The purpose of the study was to identify circumstances in CHD of relative BNP deficit. They found progressively lower BNP expression in staged univentricular repair, speculated to be “perhaps from isolated cavopulmonary failure or impaired perioperative expression of natriuretic peptide” with the implication that BNP level may not be indicative of CHD severity in all types of single-ventricle physiology.
12 The authors speculated that, especially in patients with 
Fontan palliation, BNP insufficiency may exist with physiologic implications.
12 Alternatively, unloading of the systemic ventricle 
has also been proposed as a mechanism for BNP levels similar to those of controls.
15 In the “surgical stress” group there was no 
significant difference in preoperative and postoperative BNP level, confirming that the physiologic stress of surgery alone is not a confounder. They also noted a difference in baseline preoperative BNP levels between two groups of patients, based on age: (1) neo -
natal patients with CHD who were less than 44 weeks’ gestational age (adjusted) and (2) nonneonatal patients with CHD who were more than 4 weeks of age plus older children. Median BNP levels in neonatal versus nonneonatal patients with CHD were 27 and 
7 pg/mL, r espectively. Median preoperative and postoperative BNP 
levels in neonatal CHD were 2370 versus 2140  pg/mL. M edian 
preoperative and postoperative levels within the nonneonatal group 
were significantly different (22 versus 41  pg/mL with median  
change 19  pg/mL, P < .001). As mentioned earlier, postoperative 
BNP levels were more predictive of early poor outcome ( <180 
days) than preoperative or perioperative levels. However, due to small sample sizes, heterogenous outcome measures, and weak discriminatory power of AUC of ROC, ultimately cut points for diagnostic and prognostic classification are not provided in the  
literature.

In essence, important trends in BNP levels in patients with 
CHD during and after CT surgery include the following:

•	 Wide	variation	between	and	within  CHD subsets; due to small

clinical adjunct marker preoperatively and postoperatively, at this time they are used only in conjunction and support of clinical measures of severity and echocardiographic parameters, without validated algorithms for changing clinical management. Further, from four studies, encompassing 690 subjects from birth to 18 years of age, establishing 95th and 97.5th percentiles for healthy children. Normal values of BNP have also been established by meta-analysis
18 of 195 healthy infants, children, and adolescents 
admitted for minor procedures, from birth to 17.6 years of age. In all subjects older than 2 weeks, plasma BNP concentration was 
less than 32.7  pg/mL.18 Of note, routine measurement of BNP 
versus NTproBNP varies by center, and even within  centers because 
of vendor variability, further compounding the difficulty in comparison among small CHD subsets. BNP and NTproBNP are NOT interchangeable but do have excellent correlation between log BNP and log NTproBNP in adults and in children with CHD and PH.
19-21 For the purposes of this chapter, BNP and NTproBNP 
will be referred to collectively as BNP , except where different applications or plasma levels are important.
As a broad overview of BNP in the ICU and in CHD, there 
are both surgical and nonsurgical applications, both of which will be discussed in more detail in this chapter, with synopsis of the existing literature. In the realm of nonsurgical care, BNP can be used in the diagnostic workup of dyspnea from respiratory versus cardiac causes, cardiac failure in congenital and acquired heart disease, and PH crisis in nonsurgical patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
22 BNP is the only biomarker warranting 
mention in the most recent pediatric heart failure guidelines.23 
Regarding cardiothoracic surgical care, there are preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative applications of BNP , including as a prognostic marker for outcome and major postoperative events, including low cardiac output state and postoperative PH crisis, as discussed in the following sections.
Pattern of Natriuretic Peptide Release Before, During, and 
After Cardiac Surgery
Preoperative Levels.  In their 2014 systematic review of the 
clinical utility of BNP in pediatric cardiac surgery, Afshani et  al.14 
investigated the preoperative correlation of BNP with CHD severity 
and early postoperative outcome, including 20 peer-reviewed studies that evaluated immediate postoperative BNP levels. In the preopera -
tive period they found that BNP levels were associated with cardiac failure. Preoperative BNP levels were higher in those being treated for cardiac failure than in those not being treated for cardiac failure. In univentricular hearts, BNP and NTproBNP predicted clinical cardiac failure by Ross score. After data amalgamation the authors determined the area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71%-95%) for the prediction of clinical cardiac failure, with 
an NTproBNP screening cut point of 6.75  pg/mL (sensitivity  
94%) and diagnostic cut point of 86.8  pg/mL (specificity 94%); 
Youden index was 25.1  pg/mL.14 Although their systematic review 
showed that BNP levels predicted cardiac failure and were associated with adverse outcomes, including death, low cardiac output syndrome, length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation, postoperative levels were more predictive of early poor outcome (mortality <180 days after surgery).
14 Of note, the authors’ 
attempted meta-analysis was unsuccessful due to difficulty in comparing results using different assays, small individual sample sizes, and heterogeneous outcome measures; ultimately, they did not seek to provide generalized cut points for diagnostic or prognostic classification in CHD.
14
Perioperative and Postoperative Levels.  BNP levels peak 
postoperatively between 6 and 24 hours.12,14 In the first few hours 
after computed tomography (CT) surgery, NP levels are lower than baseline, attributed to breakdown without resynthesis,

only 6 pediatric patients had values of greater than 1400  pg/mL.29 
Using this cut point of greater than 1400  pg/mL, ther e was 83% 
mortality within 2 years; using a cut point of NTproBNP level 
greater than 1664  pg/mL gav e 100% and 94% sensitivity and 
specificity, respectively, for mortality.29

elevated value within the framework of developmental regulation implies higher risk of adverse outcome.Currently there is no validated use of biomarkers specifically 
for PAH associated with CHD (APAH-CHD).
30 It will be especially 
difficult to generalize and/or create clinically useful cut points for APAH-CHD, given heterogeneity, small subsets of specific lesions, and the difference between elevation of pulmonary pressure in biventricular hearts and that in single-ventricle physiology. In a recent expert consensus statement on PH in children with CHD by the European Pediatric Pulmonary Vascular Disease Network, based on the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension in Nice in 2013 and the Pediatric Taskforce of the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute (Panama, 2011), there is no mention of biomarker use to guide therapy. Thus extrapolation of the results discussed earlier to patients with CHD should be done carefully and with the understanding that no expert consensus or validated studies exist.
Cardiac Failure Biomarker Category 2:  
ST2 and Gal3
As described previously, the two general classes of cardiac failure biomarkers are those of ventricular stretch (NPs), and those of cardiac function and fibrosis, namely, ST2 and Gal3. Both ST2 and Gal3 are gaining widespread acceptance as adult biomarkers of myocardial function, fibrosis, and remodeling based on a growing body of literature and warrant discussion for anticipated future pediatric cardiology applications, particularly in heart failure and orthotopic heart transplant. Moreover, increased utility has been demonstrated as an adjunct to BNP in heart failure in adults
31 
because both were included in the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines as risk stratifica -
tion biomarkers for acute and chronic heart failure in adults (class IIb recommendation).
32 However, increased concentrations of both 
biomarkers have been noted with concomitant noncardiac patho -
physiologies such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia, likely reflecting an inflammatory, and potentially confounding, milieu in patients with multiorgan system comorbidities.
31
Soluble ST2 Structure and Function.  ST2, a member of the 
interleukin-1 receptor family, is a receptor for interleukin-33 (IL-33). T wo isoforms of ST2 are involved in cardiac signaling and patho-genesis: soluble ST2 (sST2) and a cell membrane–bound isoform (ST2L). Binding of the membrane-bound ST2 with its ligand IL-33 results in cardioprotective signaling. However, soluble ST2 functions as a scavenger receptor and competes for IL-33 binding with the membrane bound ST2. When sST2 levels are high, IL-33 binding to the cardiac membrane bound ST2 is reduced; in the absence of IL-33/ST2L cardioprotective signaling, there is resultant cardiac cellular death, tissue fibrosis, and reduced cardiac function. for individual patients, levels should be followed for trends; random levels are meaningless at best and misleading at worst.
Brain Natriuretic Peptide in Pulmonary Hypertension.  PH is 
an increasingly frequent cause for admission to the ICU, and PH crisis is a feared complication of postoperative management for patients with both CHD and structurally normal hearts with severe pulmonary disease. BNP is the best-studied PH biomarker in both pediatric and adult populations. However, for all the reasons described earlier, BNP has limitations, especially in the pediatric population, as have most biomarkers whose discovery has been from large-volume adult studies with results extrapolated to pediatric patients. Despite lack of a standardized catheterization laboratory protocol for pediatric PH,
24 cardiac catheterization remains the 
gold standard for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring in PH. In adults with PH, BNP has been correlated with disease progression as a surrogate for invasive hemodynamics, including pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, with a negative correlation with cardiac index.
25,26 In pediatric PH, 
however, although elevated/rising BNP level is recognized as a means for high-risk versus low-risk stratification,
27 conclusive 
correlation with invasive hemodynamics has not been demonstrated. Three studies in pediatric patients that attempt to correlate BNP 
with invasive hemodynamics had mixed results. Bernus et  al.28 
found no correlation with echocardiographic or hemodynamic 
data, whereas Lammers et  al.13 found optimal correlation between 
pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and BNP when PVRI 
is lowest and most stable. Finally, although Takatsuki et  al.21 
demonstrated correlation of NTproBNP with invasive hemodynam -
ics, the low magnitude of the correlations led the authors to recom -
mend against using levels to replace clinical parameters. Finally, as noted earlier, BNP and NTproBNP are well correlated but not interchangeable, and different centers tend to collect either one or the other, rarely both, with more centers now collecting NTproBNP than in prior years. This is relevant given the assertion 
by Takatsuki et  al. that although BNP was better correlated with 
real-time hemodynamics in the cardiac catheterization laboratory,21 
NTproBNP is preferable for longitudinal monitoring with longer half-life and stable levels.
Robust correlation with functional parameters and surrogates 
for clinical end points in pediatric PH would be highly valuable, 
but at best the data are conflicting. Lammers et  al.13 found in a 
retrospective cohort of 50 children with PH that BNP levels did not correlate with 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) testing, whereas 
Van Albada et  al.,29 in a cohort of 29 pediatric patients with 
idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and associated pulmonary arterial hyperten -
sion (APAH), found that NTproBNP levels correlated with functional class and 6MWD, and initiation of treatment resulted in decreased NTproBNP levels and increased 6MWD.
Further, in adult IPAH, BNP levels greater than or equal to 
180 ng/mL pr edict worse survival outcomes,26 but attempts in 
pediatric PH to identify a similar clinical cut point have proven more difficult, presumably due to smaller sample sizes, longer time 
until outcomes of interest, and poor sensitivity. Lammers et  al.,13 
using AUC from ROC analysis of the UK Pulmonary Hypertension 
Service for Children, found that a BNP level of greater than 130  pg/
mL predicted death or need for transplant with a sensitivity of 
57.1% and specificity of 83.3%. Bernus et  al.,28 when attempting 
to extrapolate the adult value of 180  ng/mL, had only 10 patients  
with BNP level of greater than 180  ng/mL. F inally, Van Albada 
et al. attempted to ev aluate an adult PH cutoff value of NTproBNP 
level greater than 1400  pg/mL to identify patients with poor 
long-term prognosis (53% sensitivity and 88% specificity), but   484  PART  IV Basics of Diagnostics and Clinical Care
differences were found in both studies between Gal3 levels and 
severity of heart failure by the Ross classification.36,37 Kotby et  al. 
also found a statistically significant increase in Gal3 levels of those not receiving spironolactone, whereas in adult patients receiving Aldactone, Gal3 levels were decreased. Thus an increase in Gal3 levels is speculated to be due to Gal3-mediated myocardial fibrosis.
35 
Given the prevalence of Aldactone as an adjunct in heart failure in both pediatric and adult CHF patients, this is an unfortunate confounder, but it also indicates that elevated Gal3 levels may identify patients who would reap the most benefit from the antifibrotic effect of spironolactone.
35
Biomarker of Cardiac Injury: Troponin
Due to unparalleled cardiac specificity, troponins serve as acute cardiac myocyte necrosis markers and are currently the best circulat -
ing measure of acute cardiac injury. As a broad overview, use of troponin in the ICU in CHD centers around identification of cardiac ischemia, postpericardiotomy syndrome, cardiac trauma, and myocarditis.
Troponin: Structure/Function.  Cardiac troponin is the calcium-
dependent regulator of the contractile apparatus of cardiac muscle, often thought of the “switch” for cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. Three subunits constitute troponin: troponin C (calcium-binding subunit [cTnC]), troponin T (thin filament that attaches to tropomyosin [cTnT]) and troponin I (inhibits actin-myosin interactions [cTnI]). The troponins are uniquely cardiac specific and are therefore specific cardiac necrosis biomarkers. Both cTnT and cTnI have been studied in pediatric and adult cardiac patients, and both are released with cardiac injury, with cTnI being unaffected by renal failure and thus the preferred of the two.
38
Normative Pediatric Values.  Assays for cTnI and cTnT are 
FDA approved and available in most clinical laboratories. Interassay variability exists, but generally the clinical upper limit of normal is considered the 99th percentile of the normal reference population. Based on the 2002 American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology guidelines,
39 this is approximately 3 standard 
deviations from the mean of a normal adult population,40 to 
maximize sensitivity while minimizing false-positives.40 Typically 
the upper reference limit cutoff of 0.04  n g/mL is based on apparently 
healthy adults and used to risk stratify myocardial infarction in adults at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.
41 Normative values exist 
in pediatrics, with the highest concentrations immediately after birth, peaking on the third day of life, and decreasing toward adult values by the end of the first year of life.
42,43 Reported values in 
the literature tend to be more helpful to describing trends of developmental regulation, given the variety of assays used and increasing sensitivity of the assay over the decades since discovery. 
In an attempt to establish normal pediatric values, Hirsch et  al.42 
evaluated two groups of children, the first of which included ambulatory pediatric patients with no apparent cardiac disease ( n 
= 120) and patients in stable condition with known congenital 
or acquired cardiac abnormalities ( n = 96), whereas the second 
group included 65 ICU patients with a variety of acute illnesses, with the results that cTnI levels were generally not elevated in group A. As will be further described later in the chapter, troponin levels are higher in infants than older children.
38,42,44
Cardiac Ischemia in the Intensive Care Unit.  In both surgical 
and nonsurgical patients, as well as those with and without structural heart disease, cTnI and cTnT are the preferred biomarkers of cardiac injury in both adults and children, with improved sensitivity and specificity for cardiac injury over creatine kinase (CK) and sST2 has indeed been shown to be a marker of cardiac cellular death, tissue fibrosis, and reduced cardiac function in adult heart failure and transplant patients, as well as being predictive of hospitalization and mortality.
33
Normative Pediatric Values.  Normative median and 95 per-
centile ST2 values in children without heart failure were found to be similar to those of normal adults.
34 Although not statistically 
significant, higher levels were noted in males versus females when they were 15 years of age or older.
34
Pediatric Use.  ST2 shows promise as a potential biomarker of 
orthotopic heart transplant rejection in pediatric heart transplant recipients and hopefully in the overarching goal of eventual biopsy-free detection of rejection and therapeutic monitoring of antirejec -
tion medications. In a recent simultaneous biopsy and serum-based assessment of ST2 in both heart and small bowel transplant, 
Mathews et  al.35 showed that sST2 level was elevated in rejection 
and quiescent during rejection-free periods. The efficacy of this potential biomarker in two types of organ transplant supported claims that elevated sST2 level was a reflection of alloimmunity rather than just cardiac injury.
35 Immunostaining of endomyocardial 
biopsy specimens with marked increase in ST2 level during rejection, coupled with moderate discrimination by AUC of ROC analysis of serum at the time of rejection episodes, supports the circulating biomarker as a reflection of proximal graft rejection.
35 Further, 
serum levels of ST2 returned to rejection-free levels with effective treatment. Finally, given that sST2 does not require cardiomyocyte damage for secretion, such as other markers of cardiac injury, it is further proposed as a marker of early rejection.
35
Galactin-3 Structure and Function.  Gal3 is a carbohydrate-
binding protein released by activated cardiac macrophages, resulting in the induction of cardiac fibroblasts, and is found to be upregulated in decompensated heart failure. This complex interplay, with progressive accumulation of myocardial collagen and alteration of the myocardial extracellular matrix, is hypothesized to link the inflammatory milieu of myocardial injury to fibrosis.
36 Gal3 is 
also implicated in apoptosis, which is speculated to be involved in the transition from compensated to decompensated heart failure.
36 
Gal3 is an example of a biomarker that likely also plays an active role in the pathogenesis of heart failure and may have a future role as a therapeutic target or agent.
Normative Pediatric Values.  In children without heart failure, 
Gal3 levels are similar to those in previous studies in normal healthy adults.
34 Levels varied according to which FDA-approved assay 
was used; as previously mentioned as a common weakness in biomarker validation, interassay variability impedes establishment of pediatric normative values and is a source of discrepancy among biomarkers.
34 Gal3 is not correlated with gender but does show a 
positive correlation with age.
Pediatric Use.  As in adults, Gal3 has potential applicability in 
risk stratification for pediatric heart failure across causes, including CHD, but as of yet there is no current validation for its use in 
clinical management. T wo studies (by Kotby et  al.36 and Mohammed 
et al.37) have evaluated serum Gal3 levels in children, including 
patients with preserved and reduced ejection fraction in dilated cardiomyopathy, CHD, and rheumatic heart disease. Both studies found a statistically significant difference in Gal3 levels between those with heart failure, whether with preserved or reduced ejection fraction, and control patients.
36,37 Analysis of AUC of ROC showed 
a cut-off value for differentiating patients with heart failure versus 
controls of greater than 3  ng/m L with sensitivity of 100%, specificity 
of 97.78%, positive predictive value of 97.8%, negative predictive value of 100%, and diagnostic accuracy of 100%.
36 Significant   CHAPTER 38  Biomarkers in Care of Congenital Heart Disease Patients in the Intensive Care Uni t 485 
NTproBNP , knowledge of baseline values and/or trends over time 
are often more clinically relevant than a random value in time, especially given the demonstration, by increasingly sensitivity assays, that there is development/accrual of morbidity from structural and acquired heart disease, resulting in slowly rising troponin levels over time. This inherently decreases the utility of solitary cutoff  values, even in adults.
40 Further, experts in the field have theorized 
that an early release of troponin may signify reversible injury, whereas sustained release may be associated with progressive cell death.
40 Values trended over time are therefore more informative, 
and an important future goal of risk stratification will be recognizing a pattern of troponin release that may distinguish acute disease/injury from chronic elevation.
Pattern of Troponin Release During Cardiac Surgery.  Post-
operative troponin levels can have value to explain poor cardiac function, especially in cases that require coronary reimplantation. T roponin release in CHD following cardiothoracic surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been studied, with the following five themes: (1) cTnI and cTnT are of equal sensitivity and specific -
ity for myocardial injury; levels behave similarly in the early postoperative phase (up to 28 hours).
51 cTnT has been described 
as peaking 30 minutes after termination of CPB with steady decline to baseline 4 to 5 days postoperatively
52; (2) troponin I is preferable 
to cTnT as a biomarker of cardiac ischemia because it is unaffected by renal failure; (3) whereas infant myocardium is more resistant to hypoxia, congenitally abnormal myocardium is more sensitive to cardioplegic arrest,
52 with higher postoperative peak troponin 
levels in infants38,42,44; (4) higher postoperative values are associated 
with longer myocardial ischemia and extent of myocardial damage44; 
and (5) threshold levels for troponin as a marker of adverse outcome have been difficult to establish in children.
38
Similar to BNP , troponin levels have been used in adults as a 
marker of poor outcome after CPB, with values above threshold levels being associated with severe cardiac event and/or death.
53 
Similar thresholds have been proposed in pediatric cardiothoracic surgery for both cTnI and cTnT, with description of high troponin I release (especially ≥
 100 mcg/L) being associated with post-CPB  
mortality.44,54 However, as discussed previously, as assays become 
increasingly sensitive, thresholds established using older assays become obsolete, and possible pitfalls of attempting to distinguish thresholds, especially across heterogeneous patterns of cardiac injury, has the potential to mislead. Further, in a contemporary study of troponin values in infants and children with CHD undergoing 
CPB, Gupta-Malhotra et  al.38 showed that, with the caveat of 
small sample size, for the 4 patients with cTnI values above this threshold (3 infants, 1 child), none had a severe cardiac event or death. Further, infants appear to have higher postoperative values of troponin, making thresholds difficult across age ranges.
38 
Finally, differing results have been found in preoperative and postoperative troponin levels in cyanotic versus acyanotic patients, further complicating establishing a threshold value across the heterogeneous spectrum of CHD.
38 As described earlier, the 
adult cutoff value of cTnI less than 0.04  n g/mL is extrapolated 
to pediatric patients but does not account for developmental regulation, individual variance in cardiac injury, or presence of  
cyanosis.
Other Biomarkers
Evaluation of postoperative noncardiac organ system–related dysfunction in CHD is a burgeoning area of biomarker discovery; because this is addressed elsewhere in greater detail, only a brief creatine kinase–myocardial band (CK-MB) assays.
38 cTnT is a 
sensitive and specific marker of myocardial injury, given that it is not expressed by skeletal muscle, either during development, as a result of skeletal muscle injury stimulus, or following noncardiac surgery.
45 In pediatric CHD, cTnI and cTnT are sensitive and 
specific for myocardial ischemia/infarction, although cTnI is often preferred because levels are not affected by renal failure.
38 In pediatric 
cardiology, cTnI is less likely to be elevated from myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery disease, given the much lower prevalence of coronary artery disease in pediatric patients.
46 As discussed 
previously, in patients in stable condition with known congenital or acquired cardiac abnormalities, troponin levels were within the same range as those in their apparently healthy, ambulatory pediatric peers.
42 In a recent study by Harris and Gossett47 of 24 patients 
with elevated troponin levels, excluding recent cardiac surgery, “significant” CHD, neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit, or patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), only 3 had coronary-related diagnoses (anomalous origin of left coronary artery from pulmonary artery [ALCAPA] and Kawasaki disease), whereas the majority (17/24, or 71%) had myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Although left heart catheterization was com -
pleted in nearly half the cases (10/24), in no case was the diagnosis made/changed, confirming the current standard of care among pediatric cardiologists that left heart catheterization and coronary angiography is reserved for a highly selective group, avoiding routine application of adult “door-to-balloon time” protocols.
47 Currently 
troponin is used as a clinical adjunct in the diagnosis of pediatric myocarditis; however, normal levels do not rule out the presence of myocarditis.
48 Further, in a retrospective review of patients 
presenting to the emergency department with chest pain over 7 
years by Brown et  a l.,49 only 48% of those with increased troponin 
levels were attributed to primary cardiac disease, although the yield increased to 87% when combined with abnormal ECG. The median troponin level of those with cardiac cause of chest pain differed 
from those with a noncardiac cause: 8.5  ng/mL (inter quartile range 
4.6-18.5) versus 0.34  ng/mL (inter quartile range 0.12-1.3) ( P = 
.02), respectively.49 T wo other important conclusions were drawn 
from this study: (1) less likelihood of noncardiac diagnoses in 
patients if troponin level is greater than or equal to 2  ng/mL and 
(2) no correlation between level of troponin elevation and morbidity and mortality.
49 Both of these conclusions were supported by a 
recent study evaluating the contribution of diagnostic modalities toward the final diagnosis after an elevated troponin level was demonstrated, as well as the contribution of the troponin level at various times during diagnosis and treatment to the final diagnosis and ventricular function.
50 This study found that troponin values 
within each subgroup did not distinguish between cardiac causes, with a wide range of values, among which levels in myocarditis patients were not the highest. T roponin absolute value and progres -
sion were also not helpful in differentiating between preserved versus depressed ventricular function.
50
Although these studies were done in patients with no known 
history of CHD, given the findings of the study by Hirsch et  al.42 
of comparable baseline troponin levels in normative versus stable cardiac disease, they can likely be extrapolated to CHD patients.
Thus, although the differential of cTnI elevation in both 
congenital and acquired heart disease is broad, including coronary artery aneurysm, injury, anomalous origin of the coronary arteries, anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity, myocardial surgical injury, myocarditis, postpericardiotomy syndrome, and trauma, cTnI elevation in children is fundamentally different from that in adults, although adult cutoff values for normalcy are applied.

and for CK-MB: AUC 0.70, 95% CI, 0.60-0.81), with optimal cut 
points for detecting postoperative AKI for CK-MB of 2.9  mcg/L 
(sensitivity 64.2%, specificity 64.6%) and for h-FABP of 2.6  pg/

This study notably excluded neonates and intentionally chose more complicated CT surgery by RACHS-1 score, acknowledging the subsequent limitations to generalizability.

Biomarkers of Brain Injury Following  
Computed Tomography Surgery
Estimates of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes are as high as one in three in congenital heart surgery.
64 Glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP), an astrocyte protein released after astrocyte injury or death, has been linked to neurologic outcomes in pediatric and adult patients after trauma and ECMO, as well as CHD.
65,66 
GFAP is a promising potential biomarker of brain injury, levels of which have been shown to rise during CPB, especially during  
rewarming.
67
In multivariate analysis controlling for CPB time, deep hypo -
thermic circulatory arrest, and procedure risk category (RACHS), post-CPB GFAP has been shown to have a significant negative relationship with oxygen delivery nadir ( P < .03), although no 
clinical neurologic outcomes could be documented in this retrospec -
tive study of 116 infants and children with CHD.
64 Given the 
multifactorial causes for white matter injury following congenital heart surgery, including likely preoperative intrinsically delayed brain development, potential compromise of cerebral oxygen delivery during CPB, as well as the proinflammatory cascade and capillary leak triggered by CPB, a brain injury biomarker such as GFAP could have potential utility in risk stratifica -
tion, intraoperative modifications, and targeted developmental  
follow-up.

Novel Biomarkers
The literature is replete with promising biomarkers, some of which may also prove to be therapeutic targets and active modifiers of the disease process. Biomarker discovery from urine and saliva, some of the least invasively obtained biofluids, is also becoming increasingly prevalent. As tempting as it is to incorporate some of these novel tests, care must be taken to avoid ordering tests without understanding pretest probability and the meaning of results and how the test results will change clinical management. Even validated adult biomarkers cannot yet be extrapolated to pediatric care without further testing and establishment of normative values.
Key Points and Conclusion
For the practitioner using biomarkers as a clinical adjunct, the following are key points and caveats that should be kept in mind:
1. Ther e are no currently established pediatric guidelines for 
guiding any therapy solely based on biomarkers, although they can be used for risk stratification.
2. Establishing a baseline lev el is vital to utility.
3. The majority of research centers around two main classes of 
pediatric cardiac biomarkers: markers of cardiac function/failure and markers of cardiac injury.overview is provided in this chapter. T wo especially important areas of biomarker research and potential clinical utility are in postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and cerebral injury in CHD.
Biomarkers of Acute Kidney Injury  
Following CT Surgery
Postoperative AKI, defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) as serum creatinine level increase by 50% 
or more within 7 postoperative days, or 0.3  mg/dL within 48  
postoperative hours from preoperative level,55 has been estimated 
to complicate recovery in as many as 40% to 50% of children undergoing cardiac surgery,
56,57 underscoring the potential impor -
tance of an AKI biomarker for risk stratification in pediatric cardiac patients. In terms of markers of acute renal injury, pediatric studies and normative values continue to accrue; the most well studied markers are cystatin C (CysC) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). CysC, similar to creatinine, is a marker of renal function, given its constant production by nucleated cells and filtration at the renal glomerulus.
58 CysC is unaffected by muscle 
mass or sex and has been proposed as a more accurate measure of glomerular filtration rate than creatinine, which rises late in the course of disease, potentially delaying diagnosis of AKI.
56 NGAL 
is a tubular protein that is upregulated with ischemia and best detected in the urine. CysC has been validated as a marker of cardiac surgery postoperative AKI and found to be more strongly associated with urine IL-18 or kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM1) biomarker.
56 This is an important finding given the significant 
limitation of serum creatinine in the timely diagnosis, treatment, and risk stratification of cardiac surgery postoperative AKI.
56 Other 
well-studied markers of renal injury associated with CT surgery postoperative AKI include three main classes: (1) markers of tubular injury, including NGAL, for which reference ranges are established, KIM1, IL-18, and liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP); (2) markers of inflammation, including IL-6; and (3) markers of cell cycle arrest, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor–binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7). As is the hope for future biomarker use in many clinical scenarios, biomarker combinations that harness the ability to evaluate functional markers (CysC) and tubular damage markers have been evaluated, with the ability to pinpoint timing of kidney injury.
59 As discussed by Bucholz et  al.,60 although AKI prevention 
studies are not currently even established, much less proven effica -
cious, possible interventions in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery could include minimization of CPB time, avoidance of frequently used postoperative nephrotoxic medications, personalized optimization of hemodynamics/fluid management, and even possible postponement of elective procedures.
Much of the biomarker research regarding postoperative AKI 
has focused on markers of AKI, although the T ranslational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints in Acute Kidney Injury (TRIBE-AKI) consortium,
61 established to prospectively collect data on 
children undergoing cardiac surgery to validate novel kidney injury biomarkers, has also studied a panel of cardiac biomarkers. Bucholz 
et al.,60 as part of the TRIBE-AKI consortium, evaluated five cardiac 
biomarkers (NTproBNP , troponin I, troponin T, h-FABP and CK-MB) on 106 children from the TRIBE-AKI cohort undergo-ing a Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) cardiothoracic surgical procedure category of 2 to 4, finding that preoperative h-FABP and CK-MB levels are associated with the risk of postoperative AKI, providing good discrimination (AUC of    CHAPTER 38  Biomarkers in Care of Congenital Heart Disease Patients in the Intensive Care Uni t 487  
11. I n the future, using biomarkers as surrogate end points in 
clinical trials, markers of therapeutic response, and/or as a 
means of avoiding invasive procedures could revolutionize pediatric cardiac and ICU care.

Abstract
Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor/thymidine 
phosphorylase (PD-ECGF/TP) and leptin are known as potent  angiogenic factors The objective of the study was to 
evaluate these angiogenic factors VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP and leptin in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) and 
the factors that lead to angiogenesis in such cases.
Methods: Sixty CHD children were studied and divided into  two groups (n = 30); cyanotic-CHD (C-CHD) and 
acyanotic-CHD (A-CHD). Twenty five health y children were included as controls.
Results: Significantly higher serum levels of VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP acti vity and leptin were detected in patients with CHD, 
particularly in patients with C-CHD. CHD patients with SpO2 <90%, pulmonary hypertension (PH), severe pulmonary 
stenosis (PS), detectable collaterals, ca rdiomegaly and/or heart failure showed significantly higher levels of these 
factors than those with higher SpO2 or those without these findings.
Conclusion: Hypoxia, PH and PS are important factors that lead to harmful angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis could 
be essential in some cases of CHD as coarctation of aorta to enhance renal perfusion. This may provide new ways for 
therapeutic strategies aiming at re ducing or promoting angiogenesis in  CHD to improve patient's outcome.
Background
Angiogenesis or neovascularization by capillary sprout-
ing from preexisting vessels is a major physiological eventthat occurs for example in embryogenesis, wound healingand menstrual cycle. It is also, implicated in certain path-ological conditions such as atherosclerosis, diabetic retin-opathy, tumor growth, psoriasis and myocardialischemia. This could occur through the interplay of theendothelial cells, angiogenic mediators, cytokines,growth factors, and adhesion molecules [1].
Children with CHD may experience the development
of abnormal vascular channels that become a source ofsignificant morbidity and mortality. However, no entityresponsible for these abnormalities has been identifiedyet [2]. Therefore, such vessels are needed to be closedeither before or after the cardiac operation [3]. On theother hand, cases with CHD as coarctation of aorta,enlargement of preexisting or formation of new collater-als is very characteristic and essential for enhancement ofrenal perfusion as hypertension is not due to mechanical
obstruction alone, but almost certainly involves renalmechanisms [4].
Angiogenic growth factors are so called because of
their varying ability to induce the proliferation of variouscells in vitro, which contribute to the process of angio-genesis in vivo [5]. Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF), platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor/thymidine phosphorylase (PD-ECGF/TP) and leptin areknown as potent angiogenic factors [5-7]. VEGF is a basic45 kDa disulfide linked dimeric glycoprotein that bindsheparin and is structurally related to platelet derivedgrowth factors. The whole VEGF family consists of atleast five members (VEGF A-B-C-D-E) whose effects aremediated via three VEGF receptors (VEGF R-1, VEGF R-2 and VEGF R-3). Through alternate exon splicing ofVEGF gene, different mRNA are encoded producing fivebiologically active proteins (VEGF
121, VEGF145, VEGF165,
VEGF189 and VEGF206)  [ 5 ] .  P D - E C G F / T P  i s  i d e n t i c a l  t o

[8]. Despite a wealth of data linking PD-ECGF and angio-
genic pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlyingthis link have thus for remained obscure [6]. Leptin, the16 kDa non-glcosylated polypeptide product of the obesegene, is an adipocyte-derived cytokine that regulates foodintake and energy homeostasis. Leptin is also, defined asa potent angiogenic factor [9,10]. Understanding of therole of these angiogenic factors in CHD could be impor-tant in medical or surgical management of such cases [4].
Aim of work: The present study was designed to evalu-
ate the angiogenic factors (VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP and lep-tin) in children with CHD and the factors that lead toangiogenesis in such cases.
Methods
The study included 60 children with CHD diagnosedclinically and by echocardiography. They were attendingCardiology Unite at Children University Hospital, Assiut.They were divided into two groups; C-CHD (n = 30) (16boys and 14 girls). Their mean age was 3.38 ± 0.78 yearsand mean weight 10.2 ± 3.2 Kg. A-CHD group (n = 30)(22 boys and 8 girls). Their mean age was 3.20 ± 2.12years and mean weight 11.46 ± 4.82 Kg. The diseases ofC-CHD were 14 Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), 9 transposi-tion of great arteries (TGA), 7 double outlet right ventri-cle (DORV). The A-CHD had 11 ventricular septal defect(VSD), 8 pulmonary stenosis (PS), 5 coarctation of aorta,3 patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and 3 atrial septa defect(ASD). A control group of 25 apparently healthy children(15 boys and 10 girls), with mean age 3.48 ± 2.31 yearsand mean weight 13.5 ± 4.7 Kg were included in thestudy. All patients were subjected to full history taking,clinical and echocardiographic examination. Diagnostic
cardiac catheter as preoperative evaluative procedure wasdone in 15 cases {10 TOF, 2 coarctation of aorta and 3VSD with pulmonary hypertension (PH)}. Severe PS wasconsidered when the pressure gradient (PG) between theright ventricle and the pulmonary artery is >60 mmHg[11]. PH is defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure>25 mmHg at rest or >30 mmHg during exercise [11].Severe coarctation of aorta is diagnosed when the PGbetween the pre and post the coarctation segment was>60 mmHg [11]. Arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO
2)
was measured by pulse oxymeter. Patients who were
operated either with palliative or complete surgical cor-rection of CHD were excluded from the study as hemo-dynamics and angiogenesis could be alteredpostoperatively. According to age, weight, hemoglobinlevel and SpO
2 level, CHD patients were divided into {<3
ys (n = 39) and >3 ys (n = 21)}, {<10 kg (n = 34) and >10
Kg (n = 26)}, {<10 g./dl (n = 32) and >10 g./dl (n = 28)},{<90% (n = 35) and >90% (n = 25)} for comparison. Theclinical, laboratory, echocardiographic and catheter crite-ria of the studied CHD patients were presented in tables 1and 2. Most of the studied patients will undergo total cor-rective or palliative surgery according to their conditionsand will be evaluated postoperatively by echocardiogra-phy.
All parents of subjects gave written informed consent
prior to the study. The study was approved by the Com-mittee of Ethics in Medical Research at Assiut University,Faculty of Medicine.

Discussion
Abnormal blood vessel proliferation often occurs in
patients with CHD and this may represent a form ofanomalous angiogenesis, especially in the lungs or myo-cardium [15].
The present study demonstrated significant higher
mean serum levels of VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP activity andleptin in children with CHD particularly the cyanoticgroup (Table 3).
Angiogenesis normally occurs at variable rates in differ-
ent organs, because it depends on the tissue regeneration.That response is amplified under conditions that resultsin cellular hypoxia [2]. Hypoxia (decreased SpO
2) that
leads to polycythemia with increased hemoglobin level is
a strong stimulus for angiogenesis. Hu et al. [15] statedthat preoperative serum VEGF level elevation wasbecause of hypoxia in the C-CHD, but then became lowerafter surgery because of the elimination of hypoxia. Incontrast, the serum VEGF level significantly increasedpostoperatively in patients with A-CHD, possibly frommyocardial ischemia during cardiopulmonary bypass.Nevertheless, in the C-CHD hypoxia is still the maincause of the high serum VEGF levels rather than myocar-dial ischemia. The response to hypoxia is primarily medi-ated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) which leads to the induction of a variety ofadaptive gene products including VEGF [16]. Further
mechanisms leading to hypoxia-induced increase of
VEGF production may be related to the often associatedf ea t u r es  o f  h ypo x ia  su c h  as  ti ss u e  da m ag e ,  n ecr os is  an dapoptosis. These events may therefore trigger the releaseof cytokines and other chemical mediators from the cellsof the surrounding tissue, initiating a cascade of eventsleading to the production of VEGF [5]. These findings
could explain the observations of the present study thatsignificant higher mean serum levels of VEGF weredetected in C-CHD patients with higher hemoglobinlevel >10 g./dl than those with lower hemoglobin <10 g./dl and in C-CHD and A-CHD patients with lower SpO
2
level <90% than those with higher SpO2 level >90% (Table
4) and the significant positive correlation between the
levels of VEGF and hemoglobin and significant negativecorrelation between VEGF and SpO
2 (Table 7). These
findings are in agreement with those of Himeno et al. [3]
and Suda et al. [17]. However, Ootaki et al [2] found nosignificant correlation between VEGF level and SpO
2 or
RBCs. They attributed this to the fact that VEGF is classi-
fied into subgroups and some types of VEGF are notaffected by hypoxia (VEGF-B and C).
In the present study, C-CHD patients with older age >3
ys showed a significantly higher levels of VEGF thanyounger age <3 ys (Table 4). There were significant posi-tive correlations between VEGF and age (Table 7). Thesefindings are in accordance with those of Himeno et al. [3]who reported that VEGF showed significant age depen-dence. Hu et al. [15] stated that the myocardial microves-sel formation increased with age and this could beattributed to the older the age the longer the duration ofangiogenesis formation in C-CHD. Accordingly, they sug-gested that early surgical intervention may improve theoutcome of CHD. However, the study of Rivard et al. [18]reported that the expression of VEGF was impaired in oldanimals compared with younger ones.
C-CHD patients with heart failure and those with car-
diomegaly showed significant higher mean serum levelsof VEGF than patients without (Table 5). Early PH inTable 3: Serum levels of VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP activity and leptin in patients groups and controls

heart failure is characterized by altered vasoreactivity
with overexpression of VEGF [19]. Izumiya et al. [20]r e p o rt e d  t h a t  V E G F  i s  r e q u i r e d  t o  m a i n t a i n  m y o c a r d i a lcapillary density and that reduction in vascular bed isassociated with the transition from compensated hyper-trophy to heart failure. Moreover, Tirziu et al. [21] statedthat the enhancement of angiogenesis in failing heart is toimprove myocardial function. They reported that anincrease in size of vascular bed in normal heart leads toincreased cardiac mass and hypertrophy paralleled byincreased cardiac performance.
It has been shown that TP activity is critical for the
angiogenic activity of PD-ECGF/TP . TP hydrolyzes thy-midine to 2-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate (2-DDR1P) andthymine. In turn 2 DDR1P is dephosphorylated to 2-
deoxy-D-ribose (2-DDR). These ribose sugar metabolites
are strong reducing sugars that generate oxygen radicalspecies during the early stages of protein glycation. Theinduced oxidative stress has been implicated in therelease of angiogenic factor (ex. VEGF) [6,22]. In addi-tion, 2-DDR could possibly exert a chemokinetic effect by
integrating into the metabolic machinery of endothelialcell generating energy that can serve towards endothelialcell migration which has been suggested to be essentialfor angiogenesis [22]. Characterizing the angiogenicp a t h w a y s  d o w n s t r e a m  o f  T P  a c t i v i t y  w i l l  a l l o w  u s  t ouncouple angiogenesis from thymidine phosphorylysis.This is of clinical relevance to block TP-induced angio-genesis downstream of TP activity which could preventthe induction of blood vessel growth [6].
The present study revealed that mean serum activity
levels of PD-ECGF/TP activity were significantly higheri n  C H D  p a t i e n t s  w i t h  l o w  S p O
2 (Table 4). This finding
could be attributed to hypoxia. Griffiths and Dachs [23]
reported that the presence of PD-ECGF/TP is a commonfeature in all diseases characterized by hypoxia and aber-rant angiogenesis. They added that the mechanism ofhypoxic induction of PD-ECGF/TP may be similar to thatof VEGF[22,23]. These findings could explain the signifi-cant positive correlation between VEGF and PD-ECGF/Table 4: Serum levels of VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP activity and leptin in patients groups in relation to age, weight, hemoglobin 
and SpO2 levels.

TP observed in CHD patients in the present study (Table
7).
The angiogenic function of leptin demonstrates that
this endocrine hormone acts as a paracrine growth factorfor the vascular system [24]. In addition, leptin also, actsas an indirect angiogenic factor. Interestingly, leptin mod-ulates VEGF-induced vascular activity by synergisticallypromoting neovascularization in vivo [24]. The study ofsuganami et al. [7] reported that leptin stimulates neovas-cularization possibly through the upregulation of VEGFin retinal endothelial cells. This synergism is by upregula-tion of VEGF mRNA expression via activation of Janus-tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of tran-scripition (Jak-STAT) [10]. These findings could explainthe observed significant positive correlation betweenVEGF and leptin in the studied CHD patients (Table 7).Hypoxia which is a well-known stimulator of leptin syn-thesis and secretion [25], it markedly enhances theexpression of leptin and VEGF as well as stimulating HIF-1α which transactivate the leptin gene promoter [9]. Thiscould explain the present finding that significant higherserum leptin levels were observed in CHD patients withlower SpO

tions are significantly elevated in obese subjects in pro-portion to the degree of adiposity. The mechanism bywhich the increase in body fat is translated into increasein serum leptin appears to involve induction of Ob geneexpression [14]. However, the study of Hallioglu et al. [26]reported that the leptin regulating axis is intact in cyan-otic patients and does not contribute to cachexia of CHD.

Also, there was a sig-nificant positive correlation between VEGF and level ofpulmonary pressure (Table 7). This is in agreement withthat of Lam et al. [27] who detected increased expressionof VEGF in the pulmonary artery of rats with high pul-monary flow. Mata-Greenwood et al. [28] suggested thatincreased pulmonary blood flow upregulates expressionof VEGF and its receptors, and this may be important indevelopment of the vascular remodeling in the pulmo-nary artery exposed to high flow and pressure.

elevated in patients with chronic cyanosis, and may con-
tribute to the formation of extensive collateral vessels.Ootaki et al. [2] reported that, even without major abnor-mal vessels, patients with C-CHD frequently have highamounts of collateral flow by numerous small collaterals.These secondarily developed systemic pulmonary collat-erals might relate to VEGF levels. These findings maysuggest that the use of gene therapy of VEGF inhibitorsmight represent a way to limit collateral development [3].Also, significant higher serum levels of VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP activity and leptin were observed in CHD patientswith severe PS than patients with mild PS (T able 5). Aor-topulmonary collateral arteries associated with pulmo-nary atresia or severe PS may lead to several problems,including significant left to right shunting and pulmonary"steal" from systemic flow during cardiopulmonarybypass. On the other hand, the maintenance of collateralsthat extend in cases of severe coarctation of aorta to sup-ply the post stenotic ischemic tissues especially kidneys isvery essential for their perfusion. Higher blood pressurein the capillaries of the aorta proximal to the area ofobstruction leads to remodeling of the thoracic arteriesand of collateral vessels. Promoting angiogenesis in suchconditions could be very beneficial to provide betterblood supply and to reverse ischemia [4].
Study limitations
The present study has its own limitations: the broad vari-ation in circulatory dynamics within the studied groupswith various CHD. Variability of the underlying hemody-namics and anatomy may make consistent analysis diffi-cult. Another limitation was small number of the studiedCHD patients.
Conclusions
The present study represents an attempt to identify fac-tors that may have an impact on CHD. Hypoxia, PH andPS are important factors that lead harmful angiogenesisand many surgical hazards. On the other hand, angiogen-esis could be essential in cases of CHD associated withperipheral ischemia as in coarctaion of aorta to enhancerenal perfusion. These findings may aid in understandingof the control mechanisms of angiogenesis in thesepatients. This may provide new ways of research for ther-apeutic strategies aiming at reducing or promoting angio-genesis in CHD in order to improve patient's outcome.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) accounts for nearly one-third of all major congenital anomalies. CHD birth prevalence
worldwide and over time is suggested to vary; however, a complete overview is missing. This systematic review in-cluded 114 papers, comprising a total study population of 24,091,867 live births with CHD identiﬁed in 164,396 indi-viduals. Birth prevalence of total CHD and the 8 most common subtypes were pooled in 5-year time periods since1930 and in continent and income groups since 1970 using the inverse variance method. Reported total CHD birthprevalence increased substantially over time, from 0.6 per 1,000 live births (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.4 to 0.8)in 1930 to 1934 to 9.1 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 9.0 to 9.2) after 1995. Over the last 15 years, stabilization oc-curred, corresponding to 1.35 million newborns with CHD every year. Signiﬁcant geographical differences were found.Asia reported the highest CHD birth prevalence, with 9.3 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 8.9 to 9.7), with relativelymore pulmonary outﬂow obstructions and fewer left ventricular outﬂow tract obstructions. Reported total CHD birthprevalence in Europe was signiﬁcantly higher than in North America (8.2 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 8.1 to 8.3] vs.6.9 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 6.7 to 7.1]; p /H110210.001). Access to health care is still limited in many parts of the
world, as are diagnostic facilities, probably accounting for differences in reported birth prevalence between high- andlow-income countries. Observed differences may also be of genetic, environmental, socioeconomical, or ethnic origin, andthere needs to be further investigation to tailor the management of this global health problem.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause
of major congenital anomalies, representing a major globalhealth problem. Twenty-eight percent of all major congen-ital anomalies consist of heart defects (1). Reported birthprevalence of CHD varies widely among studies worldwide.
The estimate of 8 per 1,000 live births is generally accepted asthe best approximation (2 ). CHD, by deﬁnition, is present
from birth. The most practical measurement of CHD occur-rence is birth prevalence per 1,000 live births (3 ).
Massive breakthroughs have been achieved in cardiovas-
cular diagnostics and cardiothoracic surgery over the pastcentury, leading to an increased survival of newborns withCHD. Consequently, more patients with CHD reachadulthood, creating a completely new and steadily growingpatient population: patients with grown-up congenital heartdisease (GUCH). The prevalence of CHD is estimated tobe 4 per 1,000 adults (4). Patients with GUCH often needlong-term expert medical care and healthcare-related costsare high (5). Therefore, the global health burden as a result
of CHD increases quickly.
It is important to have reliable information about world-
wide CHD birth prevalence because this may lead to betterinsight into its etiology. In addition, dedicated care could bebetter planned and provided. Variation in CHD occurrencesover time and worldwide has been suggested, but a completeoverview is missing. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we provide a complete worldwide overview of thereported birth prevalence of total CHD and the 8 mostcommon subtypes of CHD from 1930 until 2010.

original research papers with Eng-lish abstracts. No time restrictionfor publication dates was used. Re-ports of large governmental birthregistries were searched online.
All titles and abstracts were
screened for study population(live births, children), type ofCHD, and birth prevalence. Stud-ies were eligible if they reportedthe birth prevalence of total CHDor 1 of the 8 most common CHDsubtypes: ventricular septal defect(VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD),pulmonary stenosis (PS), patentductus arteriosus (PDA), tetral-ogy of Fallot (TOF), coarctation(Coarc), transposition of the greatarteries (TGA), and aortic stenosis(AoS). CHD was deﬁned accord-
ing to the deﬁnition of Mitchell et al. (6 ); namely, “a gross
structural abnormality of the heart or intrathoracic great vesselsthat is actually or potentially of functional signiﬁcance.” Thisdeﬁnition excludes PDA in premature infants, Marfan syn-drome, bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse, cardiomy-opathies, and congenital arrhythmias. Papers studying onlyspeciﬁc groups (e.g., only Down syndrome), rheumatic heartdisease, or case studies of rare defects were excluded. Papersfocusing on etiology, (pre-natal) diagnosis, treatment, progno-sis, or animal research were also excluded.
After exclusion on the basis of the title and abstract, full
papers were carefully read and reconsidered according to allabovementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studiesfocusing on CHD prevalence in schoolchildren age /H110225
years or including only severe forms of CHD were excluded.When a study was eligible for inclusion, we veriﬁed thedenominator and numerator and recalculated the estimatedbirth prevalence to check accuracy. Studies with incorrect ormissing denominators or numerator were excluded. Threeauthors performed the search independently using theseinclusion and exclusion criteria. In case of disagreement, anagreement was negotiated. References of selected paperswere crosschecked with the same inclusion and exclusioncriteria.Data extraction. Selected papers were reviewed and study
characteristics were tabulated in a MS Excel for Windows(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) and Re-view Manager version 5.0 (Review Manager, The NordicCochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenha-gen, Denmark). The following study characteristics wereregistered: time period during which the study was per-formed, country, study design (retrospective or prospective),age of patients, diagnostic method, number of live births,number of patients with CHD, and birth prevalence of totalCHD and 8 CHD subtypes. Studies were grouped accord-ing to 5-year time periods since 1930 to demonstrate timetrends. Time period is taken as the period in which thestudy was performed. Before 1970, many differences inavailability of diagnostic and registration facilities betweenthe continents existed, so we used only those studiesperformed after 1970 to compare continents and incomegroups. World Bank Income groups based on gross nationalincome per capita in 2008 were deﬁned as: low income(/H11349$975), lower-middle-income ($976 to $3,855), upper-middle-income ($3,856 to 11,905), and high income(/H11350$11,906) (7).Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done in Re-
view manager 5.0, MS Excel, and SPPS version 15.0 (SPSS,Chicago, Illinois). Birth prevalence of total CHD and the 8most common subtypes were pooled using the inversevariance method. Pooled group estimates were comparedwith a chi-square test. Time trends were plotted by usingthe Savitzky-Golay smoothing technique. Heterogeneity onbasis of study design (retrospective vs. prospective), studysize, continents, income groups and time periods wasexplored by using the Q and the I
2statistics and by means
of funnel plots.
Results
Search results. The systematic literature search yielded
1,136 potential eligible studies. After exclusion, cross-
referencing, and reaching agreement on 3 studies, 114studies were included in this systematic literature review andmeta-analysis (Fig. 1, Online Table 1). This resulted in atotal study population of 24,091,867 live births with CHDidentiﬁed in 164,396 individuals. There were 12 reports ofprospective birth defect registries. Seventy-six studies usedechocardiography as the main diagnostic tool; the rest usedcombinations of diagnostic tools, such as death certiﬁcates,autopsy and surgical reports, physical examination, x-rays,and catheterization.Total CHD birth prevalence. Over time, the reported
total CHD birth prevalence increased substantially (Fig. 2),from 0.6 per 1,000 live births (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]:0.4 to 0.8) in 1930 to 1934 to 9.1 per 1,000 live births (95%CI: 9.0 to 9.2) after 1995. The increase over time wasS-shaped, with a ﬁrst steep increase from 1930 to 1960,followed by stabilization around 5.3 per 1,000 live birthsfrom 1961 to 1975, a second steep increase from the late1970s until 1995, and eventually stabilization around 9.1 per1,000 live births in the last 15 years.
Signiﬁcant geographical differences were found ( Fig. 3A).
The highest reported total CHD birth prevalence was foundin Asia (9.3 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 8.9 to 9.7]) andthe lowest in Africa (1.9 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 1.1to 3.5]). Reported total CHD birth prevalence in Asia wassigniﬁcantly higher compared with all other continents (all,p/H110210.001). Europe had the second highest reported total
CHD birth prevalence (8.2 per 1,000 live births [95% CI:8.1 to 8.3]).Abbreviations

CHD birth prevalence in high-income countries (8.0 per1,000 live births [95% CI: 7.9 to 8.1]; all, p /H110210.001).
Reported total CHD birth prevalence in upper- middle-income countries was 7.3 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 6.9to 7.7) and 6.9 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 6.1 to 7.7) inlower-middle-income countries (p /H110050.013). No data from
low-income countries were available.Birth prevalence of the 8 most common subtypes ofCHD. Reported birth prevalence of the 8 most common
CHD subtypes since 1945 is shown in Figure 4. Distribu-
tion of the 8 most common CHD subtypes worldwide isshown with percentages in Figure 5. Worldwide reported
birth prevalence of the CHD subtypes (per 1,000 live births)was: VSD, 2.62 (95% CI: 2.59 to 2.65); ASD, 1.64 (95%CI: 1.61 to 1.67); PDA, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83 to 0.91); PS,0.50 (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.52); TOF, 0.34 (95% CI: 0.31 to0.37); Coarc, 0.34 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.36); TGA, 0.31 (95%CI: 0.28 to 0.34); and AoS, 0.22 (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.24).
Signiﬁcant geographical differences in reported birth
prevalence of the 8 most common CHD subtypes weredetected (Fig. 5). Asia reported relatively more pulmonaryoutﬂow obstructions (PS and TOF) and fewer left ventric-ular outﬂow tract obstructions (Coarc and AoS). Further-more, Asia reported a lower TGA birth prevalence com-pared with Europe, North America, South America, andOceania (p /H110210.001).1136 articles

Birth Prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease November 15, 2011:2241–7 tially, from /H110211 per 1,000 live births in 1930 to 9 per 1,000
live births in recent years. With a worldwide annual birth
rate around 150 million births (8), this corresponds to 1.35million live births with CHD every year, representing amajor public health issue.
The increase in reported total CHD birth prevalence over
time may be caused by changes in diagnostic methods andscreening modalities rather than representing a true in-crease. Over the past century, knowledge about diagnostics
and treatment of CHD increased considerably. Survivalincreased dramatically due to improvements in the ﬁeld ofcardiothoracic surgery and anesthesia. Specialized pediatriccardiologists were trained, and large prospective birth defectregistries became available. Before the era of echocardiog-raphy, detection of CHD was dependent on autopsy re-ports, death certiﬁcates, physical examination, x-rays, cath-eterization, and surgical reports. Therefore, only severelyaffected subjects could be detected. In the 1970s, echocar-diography was widely introduced into clinical practice,making it possible to also diagnose asymptomatic patients aswell as patients with mild lesions (9). This developmentprobably explains the increased birth prevalence of totalCHD in the 1970s, as well as the increase in speciﬁc groups,
such as patients with VSD, ASD, and PDA. Furthermore,
echocardiography currently is often used as a screening toolbefore (noncardiac) surgery or full assessment in case of
noncardiac disease, causing an increase in diagnoses of minorlesions such as a small VSD or ASD. Our results conﬁrmﬁndings from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital DefectsProgram that routine use of echocardiography has increaseddiagnosis of minor defects (10). The relative stability of theestimation of birth prevalence of complex CHD subtypes alsoargues for a merely methodological increase.
Nonetheless, there are arguments that not only the
reported but also the true CHD birth prevalence changed
over time. Survival of premature infants has improved overthe last century, attributing to an increase in total CHD andespecially VSD birth prevalence (4). Because increasingnumbers of women in developed countries are delayingchildbearing to an older age, maternal age has increased inthe last decades, consequently causing a higher birth prev-alence of congenital abnormalities (11,12). In addition, thepatient population with GUCH is steadily increasing andtheir offspring is at increased risk of having a congenitalabnormality (13). Furthermore, one might hypothesize that
changes in environmental exposures—for example, due toindustrialization and urbanization—over the past centuryhave had effects on CHD birth prevalence.

November 15, 2011:2241–7 Birth Prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease sures, vitamin A use, marijuana use, and exposure to organic
solvents have been proven to be associated with increasedrisk of CHD (14). Exposure to ionizing radiation in
occupational settings or in clinical practice did not show anyassociations with CHD birth prevalence (14). Data aboutalcohol consumption, hard drugs, or cigarette smoking
during pregnancy are insufﬁcient to determine risk forCHD. The impact of increased use of fetal echocardiogra-phy and pregnancy termination on reduction of CHD birthprevalence is expected in the next time periods (15).
Furthermore, in the upcoming decades we will probably seethe effect of improving ﬁgures on infant survival andsocioeconomical circumstances in developing countries onCHD birth prevalence.Geographical and income group differences in CHDbirth prevalence. Important geographical differences were
found. Asia reported the highest total CHD birth preva-lence (9.3 per 1,000 live births). This ﬁnding could in partbe attributed to high consanguinity rates in some studypopulations (e.g., in Iran and India) (16,17). CHD birthprevalence among children with consanguineous parentswas found to be considerably higher than in nonconsan-guineous parents, suggesting an important genetic inﬂuence(16). Very interesting is the relatively high birth prevalenceof pulmonary outﬂow tract obstructions (PS and TOF) andlow birth prevalence of left ventricular outﬂow tract obstruc-tions (Coarc and AoS) in Asia. These ﬁndings conﬁrm theresults of Jacobs et al. (18), who found that white childrenseem to have more left ventricular obstructive lesions,whereas Chinese children have more right ventricular out-ﬂow tract lesions. A possible explanation could be found in
genetic origin.
Interestingly, Europe had the second highest reported
total CHD birth prevalence. The difference between Eu-rope and North America (8.2 vs. 6.9 per 1,000 live births;p/H110210.001) was unexpected because the study populations
and design of the studies in these 2 continents are quite
comparable. This difference might be attributed to ethnic,socioeconomical, and environmental differences. NorthAmerica has a relatively larger population of African-American inhabitants and, as previously described, CHD isless common in this population (19). Part of the differencemight also be explained by differences in healthcare andreferral systems. In the United States, as was noted in theBaltimore-Washington Infant Study (20), referral of infantswith developmental abnormalities, such as Down syndromeand other trisomies, for cardiac evaluation can be inhibited,whereas these societal factors probably are of less impor-tance in most European countries. Moreover, the fact thatwe found important differences in CHD birth prevalenceaccording to income status also argues in favor of the factthat lack of resources, medical insurance, screening pro-grams, and referral systems probably lead to an underesti-mation of the true birth prevalence.Heterogeneity in this meta-analysis. Obviously, reported
birth CHD prevalence reﬂects the true CHD birth preva-
lence but also depends on the study design of the originalpapers, study population selection, and diagnostic toolsused. CHD prevalence highly depends on age and gesta-tional age. For example, PDA in preterm babies is a0.000.501.001.502.002.503.00

infants (21). Furthermore, CHD prevalence highly dependson the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the detection method.Differences in study population selection and inclusion andexclusion criteria of included studies attributed to hetero-geneity in this meta-analysis. Tests for heterogeneityshowed high heterogeneity in continents, income groups,and time periods, but this ﬁnding can be explained by thefact that, due to the very large sample sizes, point estimateswere very precise and SEs very small, and therefore heter-ogeneity was expected and inevitable. We did not ﬁnd biascaused by the design (prospective or retrospective nature) orsize of included studies.Study limitations. Even though we investigated all avail-
able reports of total CHD and CHD subtype birth preva-lence worldwide, checked for bias caused by study design,and adjusted comparisons to the era of echocardiography,some residual bias may be present in our estimates (e.g.,caused by differences in quality of the papers). It remainsdifﬁcult, as stated by others, to determine whether detecteddifferences in CHD birth prevalence are real or merelymethodological (22). Another inevitable limitation of thismeta-analysis is that it does not really cover the entire worldpopulation. Data from developing countries were scarce,and studies often do not include indigenous inhabitants andtribes. Population-wide prospective birth defect registriesare necessary to determine the true birth prevalence, includ-ing economically developing parts of the world.
Conclusions
Reported total CHD birth prevalence increased substan-
tially over the last century, reaching a stable estimate of 9per 1,000 live births in the last 15 years. This corresponds to1.35 million newborns with CHD every year, representing amajor global health burden. Signiﬁcant geographical differ-ences were found. It remains uncertain whether detecteddifferences in CHD birth prevalence represent true ormerely methodological differences. In the future, the etiol-ogy of CHD needs to be further clariﬁed and population-wide prospective birth defect registries covering the entireworld population are needed to determine the exact birthprevalence.

Abstract
Introduction: Paediatric heart failure is a common clinical syndrome that may be experienced
by children with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or cardiomyopathy. It is characterised byclinical signs/symptoms which reflect the underlying pathophysiology based on one of threemain clinical states: Pulmonary over-circulation, pressure overload, and ventricular failure.Current diagnosis relies on clinical assessment and echocardiogram imaging as cardiac bio-markers has been predominantly scientific to date. This review provides a comprehensive over-view of paediatric heart failure pathophysiology and considers the available evidence for cardiacbiomarkers in this setting. Methods: A literature review was completed using MEDLINE ALL,
EMBASE, and PubMed on 10th November, 2022. Search terms included biomarkers, heart fail-ure, heart defects, congenital heart disease, fontan circulation, single ventricle circulation,cardiomyopathy, and child. This allowed the identification of individual cardiac biomarkerswhich are the focus of this review. These included NT-proBNP, MR-proANP, MR-
proADM, troponin, sST2, galectin 3, and growth differentiation factor-15. Results:
Paediatric studies have established reference ranges for NT-proBNP and troponin for childrenwith structurally normal hearts. Of all the biomarkers reviewed, NT-proBNP appears to cor-relate most closely with symptoms of heart failure and ventricular dysfunction onechocardiogram. However, there remains limited longitudinal data for NT-proBNP, and novalidated reference ranges for patients with CHD and/or cardiomyopathy. None of the otherbiomarkers reviewed were consistently superior to NT-proBNP. Conclusion: Further large
paediatric studies of patients with heart failure are needed to validate NT-proBNP in CHDand to evaluate the role of novel biomarkers in specific types of CHD, e.g. single ventriclephysiology.
Paediatric heart failure is defined by the International Society for Heart & Lung Transplantation
(ISHLT) as “a clinical and pathophysiologic syndrome that results from ventricular dysfunction,
volume, or pressure overload, alone or in combination ”.1Kantor et al describe it as “as the failure
of the heart to supply blood to either systemic or pulmonary circulation at an appropriate rate offlow or to receive venous return at an appropriate filling pressure, resulting in adverse effects onthe heart, the circulation, and the patient ”.

In high-income countries, paediatric heart failure is primarily caused by congenital heart
disease (CHD) or cardiomyopathy. In low- and middle-income countries, rheumatic heart dis-ease and infective endocarditis remain the most common causes of paediatric heart failure. It isimportant to understand the background pathophysiology to paediatric heart failure before con-sidering the role of various plasma biomarkers in this disease process. In clinical medicine, weroutinely measure various plasma components which have an active role in the body to diagnoseand monitor a patient ’s health. In adult patients, cardiac biomarkers are recommended in the
diagnosis of heart failure and to aid clinical management. However, in paediatric patients theiruse has remained mostly scientific as a result of differences in the underlying mechanism ofcardiac dysfunction and influence of age affecting the assay levels.
This review provides a comprehensive overview of paediatric heart failure caused by CHD
and cardiomyopathy and considers the available evidence for cardiac biomarkers in this com-plex, multifactorial condition.
A literature review was completed using MEDLINE ALL, EMBASE, and PubMed on 10th
November 2022. Search terms included biomarkers, heart failure, heart defects, CHD, Fontancirculation, single ventricle circulation, cardiomyopathy, and child.

Pulmonary over-perfusionChildren with significant left to right shunting of blood secondary
to congenital cardiac conditions such as large septal defects andpersistent ductus arteriosus may experience clinical heart failuresecondary to pulmonary over-circulation (See Figure 1).
Significant atrioventricular valvar regurgitation may also cause
increased volume overload in the atria and exacerbate pulmonary
over-circulation. For affected infants, the reduction in pulmonaryvascular resistance a few weeks after birth results in symptoms ofrespiratory distress, failure to thrive, and recurrent lower respira-tory tract infections. Importantly, whilst these children may expe-rience significant comorbidities secondary to congestive heartfailure, their ventricular function is usually well preserved, and theywill make a good recovery post-surgical repair.

Pressure overload
Children with significant left-sided cardiac obstructions may show
signs of heart failure secondary to reduced cardiac output. Criticalaortic stenosis or neonatal coarctation of the aorta both put abnor-mal pressure on the left ventricle, cause left ventricular remodel-ling, and reduced ventricular function if untreated (See Figure2).
4Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can develop left
ventricular hypertrophy secondary to marked fibrosis and disarray
of cardiac myocytes. For some patients, this causes left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction, subsequent pressure overload, and heartfailure symptoms.
5
Pump failure
Ventricular dysfunction can result from ischaemic injury, arrhyth-
mias, and myocardial failure which leads to systemic and/or pul-monary hypoperfusion. Ischaemic myocardial injury in children iscaused by conditions such as myocarditis, Kawasaki disease, andabnormalities of the coronary arteries. Ischaemia causes ventricu-lar remodelling and reduced ventricular pump function.
Children with single ventricle physiology may also experience
pump failure during their staged palliation or following the com-pletion of Fontan circulation. This is a result of reliance on themorphological right ventricle to maintain the systemic circulationand subsequent ventricular dysfunction over time.Cardiomyopathies in children cause atrial and ventricular
remodelling which in turn affects pump function.
6Dilated cardio-
myopathy may be inherited, acquired, or associated with autoim-
mune and metabolic conditions.7Dilated cardiomyopathy is
characterised by ventricular remodelling and haemodynamic over-load as a result of reduced sarcomere contractility and increasedventricular volumes to maintain cardiac output (See Figure 3).
This progressive ventricular dilatation leads to tricuspid and mitral
valve insufficiency which further reduces systolic function,increases ventricular wall stress and myocardial injury, and con-tributes to ventricular dysfunction and pump failure.
8
Role of biomarkers
Current adult NICE guidelines advise measuring NT-proBNP as
the first-line investigation in suspected heart failure because ofits high diagnostic accuracy. Similarly, cardiac troponin I and T
are recommended by NICE for diagnosis of acute coronary syn-
drome and screening of chest pain. However, the current ISHLTpaediatric guidelines advise brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNPcan be used as an adjunctive marker in the integrated evaluationand monitoring of children with known heart failure but should
not be used as a stand-alone test for diagnosis.
1Therefore, cardiac
biomarkers are routinely used in adults but not in paediatricpatients. This is due to the complex, multifactorial mechanismof heart failure in children and the limited number of large paedi-
atric research studies. Given that heart failure may be the first pre-
sentation of structural heart disease in children,
9and is often a
complicated clinical state to monitor, a widely available blood bio-marker to aid diagnosis and prognosis would improve outcomes inpaediatric patients as it has in adults.
Natriuretic peptides
Atrial naturetic peptide and brain naturetic peptide are primarily
produced in cardiac cells, namely atrial and ventricular cardiomyo-
cytes. The cardiac natriuretic hormones are synthesised by cardi-omyocytes as prohormones, i.e. proANP and proBNP. They arethen split into two fragments at the point of secretion: the inactiveprecursor, i.e. NT-proANP and NT-proBNP, and the active hor-
mone, i.e. atrial naturetic peptide and brain naturetic peptide.

to right shunt.504 C. McGinn et al.
https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951123000331  Published online by Cambridge University Press The main mechanical stimulus for atrial naturetic peptide and
brain naturetic peptide secretion is atrial and ventricular distensionrespectively, although studies suggest multiple other proteins/hor-mones can promote secretion including endothelin-1, α-adrener-
gic agonists, and angiotensin II, glucocorticoids, vasopressin,growth factors and cytokines.
11
Both atrial naturetic peptide and brain naturetic peptide bind to
natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A or guanylyl cyclase-A).They exert similar effects within target tissues namely they reduce
vascular tone, increase electrolyte and water excretion, functionally
antagonise the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) andhave antifibrotic and antihypertrophic effects.
12
Brain naturetic peptide and NT-proBNP
Early studies of paediatric heart failure in CHD and cardiomyopa-
thy focused on brain naturetic peptide measurements but this hasbeen widely overtaken by focusing on brain naturetic peptide ’s pre-
cursor NT-proBNP given its longer half-life and stability.
13
NT-proBNP is the most widely studied cardiac biomarker in
paediatric heart failure and although it is influenced by age, sexand underlying cardiac condition, it appears to be the most sensi-tive and specific biomarker of cardiac dysfunction available. Inhealthy children, NT-proBNP levels are highest in the first yearof life and then decrease steadily throughout childhood.
14,15
Roche have generated reference values (see Table 1) for NT-
proBNP based on the Albers et al study published in 2006 whichincluded 408 participants. These values can be applied to healthy
children with structurally normal hearts to aid interpretation of
NT-proBNP levels. The LIFE Child study included 2522 childrenaged 3 months to 18 years and determined reference ranges basedon 97.5th percentiles for healthy children. They also comparedthese to the study by Albers et al.
16They supported the previous
findings that NT-proBNP is elevated in the first year of life anddemonstrated a steady decrease in NT-proBNP levels during child-hood to adult levels as the child reaches puberty. Given their largersample population, they had less variability than Albers et al andmay therefore be worth considering as the most accurate referenceranges for 97.5th percentiles of NT-proBNP in healthy childrenbased on age.Both Albers et al and the LIFE child study highlight that females
have higher baseline NT-propBNP than males of the same age.
Whilst it is useful to establish reference ranges for NT-proBNP
in healthy children based on age and sex, we must consider theimpact of CHD on baseline levels of NT-proBNP. This is becausestudies suggest that the presence of structural cardiac disease
impacts baseline NT-proBNP levels for individual patients and
therefore the healthy children reference ranges cannot be reliedon for similarly aged children with a structural abnormality.
To improve our understanding of how to interpret NT-proBNP
levels in paediatric patients, we must first consider the clinical indi-cation or need for this biomarker. In adult patients, elevated NT-
proBNP levels aid diagnosis of heart failure in primary and secon-
dary care. In children, heart failure is multi-factorial and maymimic other pathologies, e.g. respiratory or infectious conditions.Therefore, NT-proBNP needs to be used with a clear clinical ques-tion before it can be considered as a diagnostic tool in paediatric

paediatrics is aiding diagnosis of heart failure at initial presenta-
tion. BNP and NT-proBNP are both significantly elevated in paedi-atric patients with respiratory distress secondary to cardiac diseasecompared to respiratory distress secondary to respiratory diseaseand healthy controls.
17–19Therefore, it could be used as a screening
tool in the assessment of suspected heart failure in children who
present with respiratory symptoms.
In CHD, brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP is proven to
correlate to symptoms of heart failure through Ross and/orNYHA classification systems.
13,20,21Importantly, NT-proBNP also
correlates to objective measures of ventricular function on
echocardiogram.22–24A higher BNP/NT-proBNP is associated
with increased symptoms of heart failure and reduced EF sug-gesting an increased likelihood of adverse outcomes.
However, because of the small number of paediatric patients
who have been studied, there is not a clear definitive brain naturetic
peptide/NT-proBNP assay level that could be used as a reference
value to diagnose heart failure in children with an underlying car-diac condition. As previously discussed, brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP reference ranges based on age and sex are usefulbut we must consider if reference ranges for children with CHD
and other comorbidities can be developed.
Salem et al, in their paper published in 2021, suggested on-
admission brain naturetic peptide at a cut-of-point 507.13 pg/mlhas 95.5% sensitivity and 88% specificity for in-hospital mortal-ity.
25Despite lack of assay cut-off values in congenital cardiac dis-
ease, this suggests brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP may be
utilised as a prognostic indicator in known cardiac disease toaid earlier identification of patients most at risk of adverse
outcomes.
Similarly, an elevated brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP pre-
operatively is associated with increased adverse events and/orincreased circulatory support requirement post operatively.
26,27
One study of 86 patients with complex cardiac disease scheduled
for biventricular repair, of which most had evidence of mild heartfailure symptoms, had preoperative brain naturetic peptide levelsmeasured before surgical intervention. They found that a preop-
erative brain naturetic peptide level >60.9pg/ml was associated
with increased risk of an adverse event.
26This suggests brain
naturetic peptide has the potential to identify higher risk patientsfor adverse outcomes even if they are clinically stablepreoperatively.
However, postoperative brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP
levels appear to be less useful in predicting adverse events and post-operative prognosis. This is likely because of the influence of acute
cardiomyocyte injury causing an acute brain naturetic peptide/
NT-proBNP assay level rise which will recover and is an inaccurateassessment of potential ventricular failure in this period.
28,29
Role of NT-proBNP in single ventricle physiology
Brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP is significantly elevated in
patients with heart failure secondary to single ventricle physiologycompared to children with similar anatomy who are not clinicallyin heart failure.
30–32Studies have found that brain naturetic pep-
tide/NT-proBNP baseline levels reduce with each subsequent stageof palliative surgery regardless of heart failure status.
33It has been
Figure 3. Cardiac remodelling in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy.506 C. McGinn et al.
https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951123000331  Published online by Cambridge University Press suggested that once children have undergone their Fontan pro-
cedure, if they do not clinically have signs/symptoms of heart fail-ure, there is no difference in their brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP levels compared to a healthy age matched control.
34
Ghelani et al report a negative correlation between ejection fractionon cardiac MRI and NT-proBNP in Fontan patients in NYHAClass I-II. They suggested NT-proBNP >150 pg/ml may be used
as an indicator of ventricular dysfunction.
35Similarly, a study of
133 Fontan patients with a median age of 13.2 years found thatthe 27% of patients who had an adverse cardiac outcome had sig-nificantly higher NT-proBNP levels at recruitment and their NT-proBNP level correlated with severity of event.
36
This highlights the potential role of NT-proBNP as a prognostic
indicator in Fontan patients given that it is elevated prior to clinical
symptoms or signs of ventricular dysfunction and correlates to car-
diac MRI findings.
Role of NT-proBNP in cardiomyopathy
A longitudinal study of paediatric patients with dilated cardiomy-
opathy found that NT-proBNP was useful in identifying the
patients at recruitment who were most likely to deteriorate overtime. In addition, within the group that would deteriorate, itwas able to distinguish between those who would experienceadverse events (heart transplant or death) and those who did not.
37
Studies show higher brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP levels
in children with heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathycompared to CHD. This may be partly because of the increasedprevalence of heart failure in the dilated cardiomyopathy subgroupand the associated systolic impairment which causes elevated brainnaturetic peptide/NT-proBNP compared to the effect of volumeoverload as seen in the CHD subgroups.
21,22,38
Role of NT-proBNP in haemodynamically significant shunts
In infants and young children, septal defects causing pulmonary
overperfusion may result in symptomatic heart failure. NT-proBNP has been shown to positively correlate to shunt size inatrial and ventricular septal defects and to fall following closurecorrelating to reduced symptoms of heart failure.
39–44NT-
proBNP has also been reported to be positively correlated with
symptoms of heart failure and in-hospital mortality in haemody-
namically significant shunts.45Clinically, NT-proBNP may be used
to aid risk stratification and identification of children with morehaemodynamically significant left to right shunts in known septaldefects.
Correlation to imaging
An advantage of NT-proBNP would be if it could identify cardiac
dysfunction or improvement before evident on imaging. Yet fewstudies have monitored serial brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP levels in children with heart failure and compared themwith cardiac function on echocardiogram. One study of 30 childrenwhich identified elevated NT-proBNP levels in children with heartfailure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy showed there was asignificant difference in NT-proBNP levels following 1 week ofmedical heart failure therapy despite a non-significant change inecho findings.
46Another small study which used tissue doppler
echocardiogram imaging in children with cardiomyopathy secon-dary to ectopic atrial tachycardia concluded that tissue dopplerimaging correlates better to elevated NT-proBNP levels than stan-
dard 2D echocardiogram parameters in terms of identifying earlydiastolic dysfunction.
47This highlights the potential role of brain
naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP in identifying myocardial changesand function before evident on 2D-echocardiography and theimportance of larger scale research in this area.
Atrial naturetic peptide
Atrial naturetic peptide/MR-proANP has shown similar results
in paediatric heart failure diagnosis and prognosis as brainnaturetic peptide/NT-proBNP. A trial naturetic peptide appears
to be significantly elevated in patients with heart failure com-pared to healthy controls, and increased in a stepwise manner
to reflect increasing Ross or NYHA class of heart failure.Studies show that as patients received treatment and theirNYHA score improved, their atria l naturetic peptide assay level
reduced in keeping with similar studies focusing on brainnaturetic peptide.
48–51Atrial naturetic peptide values were found
to be highest amongst children with cardiomyopathy comparedto CHD.
50When atrial naturetic peptide and brain naturetic pep-
tide are compared directly in asse ssment of paediatric heart fail-
ure, the changes noted in brain naturetic peptide/NT-proBNP arereflected by atrial natur etic peptide/MR-proANP.
21,23,52–54This
supports the belief that naturetic peptides have a role in paediatric
heart failure diagnosis and monitoring but that brain natureticpeptide/NT-proBNP and atrial naturetic peptide/MR-proANP
perfom similarly and there is therefore little merit in pursuingboth as a biomarker of heart failure.
Troponin
Troponins are cardiac-specific proteins which make up thin fila-
ments, which along with thick filaments, form the sarcomerewhich is the contractile apparatus of cardiomyocytes.
55When car-
diomyocytes are damaged, troponin is released into the bloodstream and can be detected almost immediately following anischaemic or hypoxic event.
56Transient levels are also detected
in chronic conditions which are understood to be secondary tonecrosis. Chronic kidney disease is associated with increasedserum troponin levels in the adult population due to reduced renal
clearance and continuous myocardial damage from exposure to
uraemic and other renally cleared toxins.
57
Troponin I and troponin T are established highly sensitive bio-
markers of acute myocardial injury and are used widely in the diag-nosis and monitoring of acute coronary syndrome in the adultpopulation.
56,58Troponin I and troponin T perform similarly in
adult studies assessing acute myocardial events59and are both used
in the paediatric studies in this review.
In paediatric patients, ischaemic cardiac disease is rare and
caused by inflammatory and structural abnormalities rather thanatherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Therefore, troponin has arole in aiding diagnosis of suspected inflammatory conditions, e.g.pericarditis or myocarditis, but the role in heart failure is less clear.Although troponin is not recommended as a biomarker for diag-nosis of heart failure in adults in NICE guidelines, studies in adultssuggest that increased troponin T levels are associated with greaterrisk of developing heart failure. Models using both BNP and tro-ponin T are better at predicting future adverse events than BNPalone as they can identify evidence of myocyte damage in additionto myocyte stretch.
56
Bohn et al performed troponin T measurements using the
Roche assay on 598 serum samples from healthy children aged0–19 years. They found that troponin T levels initially increasedCardiology in the Young 507
https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951123000331  Published online by Cambridge University Press from 0 to 6 months of age and then decline steadily after 1 year old
until adulthood.60The gender-specific 99th percentiles from 1 to
<19 years were 14 ng/L for males and 11 ng/L for females. They
proposed reference ranges for healthy children without structuralcardiac disease based on these results (see Table 2).
60
It appears that children with CHD have a higher baseline tro-
ponin level than healthy children regardless of heart failure sta-tus.
61Studies of children with heart failure secondary to
biventricular physiology have found a correlation between tropo-nin levels and clinical and/or echocardiogram evidence of heartfailure, yet when compared to BNP, troponin remains diagnosti-cally and prognostically inferior.
25,62A small study of single ven-
tricle patients which compared those with clinical evidence ofheart failure to those without found that cTnI was unable to dis-tinguish clinical heart failure in this cohort.
31
Studies have also focused on troponin in children with evidence
of pressure or volume overload. They describe that a rise in tropo-nin levels is evident before changes on conventional or 2D-STEderived strain echocardiogram
63,64and that troponin levels were
more elevated in the children with pressure overload syndromescompared to volume overload.
65Whilst this suggests a potential
role for troponin in identifying myocardial damage before evidenton echocardiogram, it isn't clear if this has clinical impact.
Troponins have been measured in the perioperative period to
assess short and long-term outcomes for children with CHD
who undergo surgery. Studies suggest that preoperative troponin
levels can be used as an adverse outcome indicator,
26and patients
with higher troponin levels are at an increased risk of adverse out-comes in the immediate postoperative period. Serial monitoring ofpostoperative troponin levels found that troponin levels correlatedto degree of myocardial damage and were significantly higher inthe immediate postoperative period, and in patients requiringincreased levels of respiratory and inotropic support.
66–71It may
be that a degree of this troponin rise is because of surgical manipu-lation on the myocardium.
Similarly, the available studies were unable to find a correlation
between immediate postoperative troponin levels for children withCHD and long-term outcomes. This would suggest a degree ofmyocardial remodelling in children, and that even patients withsevere ischaemic injury may recover some function if they survivethe immediate postoperative period.
72–74
MR-proADM
Adrenomedullin is a peptide hormone secreted by endothelial and
vascular smooth muscle cells. There are adrenomedullin receptorand binding sites throughout the body, but they are particularlyconcentrated in the heart and lungs. MR pro-ADM is the stableinactive prohormone which is enzymatically converted to thebiologically active adrenomedullin-amide and mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proAM).
75
Adrenomedullin ’s roles involve vasodilation and maintenance
of endothelial integrity to reduce vascular leakage. Studies demon-strate high levels of circulating levels of adrenomedullin in adultpatients with volume overload secondary to sepsis and acute heartfailure. There are currently small clinical trials studying the effectof adrenomedullin as a novel therapy in adult congestive heartfailure using Adrecizumab a humanised, monoclonal, non-neutralizing antibody against the N-terminus of adrenomedullin.
54
There is promising evidence that it may improve haemodynamicand hormonal outcomes for adult patients with volumeoverload.There are few paediatric studies which study the role of MR pro-
ADM in diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. It appears to havea limited role, performing less well than NT pro-BNP or MR-proANP in children with heart failure secondary to CHD orcardiomyopathy.
21However, one small study of 53 patients found
it was significantly raised in children with failing Fontan circula-
tion, correlated to NYHA score, and was more reliable than NTpro-BNP in identifying failing Fontan circulation.
76MR pro-
ADM may have a role in monitoring heart failure in the Fontanpopulation given venous return relies on peripheral muscle pump
function in this cohort.
MR pro-ADM has also been studied in the perioperative period.
One small study, focusing primarily on vasoactive inotropic scoresfollowing cardiac surgery, found that including postop MR pro-ADM levels did not aid predictive value to their score.
72
However, other studies concluded that both pre and postoperative
MR pro-ADM levels correlated to length of mechanical ventilation
and PICU stay.77,78One study of postoperative MR pro-ADM lev-
els suggested a cut-off value of MR pro-ADM of 1.223nmol/L mayindicate higher likelihood of mechanical ventilation requirementpost operatively.

Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 is a circulating form of

ity-2 serum levels are associated with increased heart failure and
mortality in adult patients with heart disease.
80–83
There are a limited number of studies focusing primarily on
paediatric heart failure and serum levels of Soluble suppressionof tumorigenicity-2 and not all results are consistent.
In a small study comparing biomarker levels in children and
adults pre and post ventricular assist device insertion, it was
found that Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 levels were
significantly higher in childre n with heart failure than healthy
children with no underlying CHD. They also found that solublesuppression of tumorigenicity-2 levels were higher in children
compared to adults at all timepoints.
84However, a prospective
study of participants with heart failure secondary to CHD and
cardiomyopathy which compared t o healthy controls found that
soluble suppression of tumorigeni city-2 was unable to show a sig-
nificant difference between patients with heart failure and healthycontrols.
21
A longitudinal study of patients with Fontan circulation found
that higher baseline soluble supp ression of tumorigenicity-2 lev-
els were associated with increased likelihood of adverse events,but no cut-off values were proposed.
36Ghelani et al found sup-
pression of tumorigenicity-2 ne gatively correlated to ejection
fraction in clinically stable Fo ntan patients, but it was not sta-
tistically significant and performed worse than NT-proBNPand troponin.
35
Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 may have a role in
diagnosis and monitoring of paediatric heart failure, but giventhe difference in pathophysiology compared to adults, this may
be limited and warrants further studies before routine use.Galectin-3
Galectin-3 is a member of the galectins which are evolutionarily
conserved proteins with the ability to bind β-galactosides through
characteristic carbohydrate-recognition domains.
85,86Galectin-3 is
highly expressed in myeloid, epithelial, endothelial cells, and fibro-blasts. It can be located both intracellularly in the cytoplasm,
nucleus, and membranes and in the extracellular matrix.
Galectin-3 is a multifunctional protein which affects cell
growth, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation,
tumour growth, and fibrogenesis. It is widely distributed in tis-sues throughout the human body and although its baselineexpression levels vary between organs, it is inducible by cardiacinjury. Because of its expression in activated macrophages and
damaged cardiomyocytes, it induc es fibroblast proliferation
and collagen deposition which eventually leads to reduced car-
diac function.
87,88
Studies of children with heart failure suggest that galectin-3 lev-
els are positively correlated to both clinical signs of heart failure
and ejection fraction on echocardiogram. One study of childrenexperiencing congestive heart failure secondary to left to rightshunt physiology, highlighted that there was positive correlationbetween Ross score and galectin-3 levels. Galactin-3 showed a bet-
ter diagnostic value than Ross heart failure classification score in
early diagnosis of heart failure in this cohort.
89Similarly, in a
cross-sectional study of children and adults with heart failure,NYHA score was positively correlated with galectin-3 levels, and
galectin-3 was negatively correlated to ejection fraction and posi-
tively correlated with NT-proBNP.
90
However, galectin-3 ’s role in determining long-term prognosis
is uncertain as some studies did not find significant correlationbetween baseline galectin-3 levels and long-term outcomes andmortality.
36,89,91Similarly, a longitudinal multicentre study con-
ducted of 133 patients post Fontan found that whilstTable 3. Summary of cardiac biomarkers and their current role in paediatric heart failure assessment

Galectin-3 may have a role in mo nitoring response to medical
management of heart failure. One study noted that galectin-3 lev-els for children with heart failure were lower in those treated withspironolactone, presumably because of improved cardiac func-tion. A study of adults and childre n with heart failure suggested
that adults with lower galectin-3 l evels treated with statins had a
better response to those with higher levels and galectin-3 could beused to better guide medical management in early heartfailure.
90,93
The current evidence suggests that galectin-3 may have a role in
diagnosis and monitoring of heart failure in children and couldguide medical management. It may be superior to sST2 despiteboth being associated with myocardial fibrosis.
80However, further
large studies which compare galectin-3 levels and NT-proBNP inestablished paediatric heart failure are needed to consider if it hasany role above that established by NT-proBNP.
Growth differentiation factor-15
Growth differentiation factor-15, also known as macrophage
inhibitory cytokine, is a member of the growth factor beta cytokinesuperfamily. In normal physiological state, it is expressed in lowamounts in many tissues except for placental and prostate tissuein which it is found in higher concentrations. In heart tissue, itis found to rapidly increase with inflammation and ischaemia. Itis also noted to increase with advancing age which is likely dueto oxidative stress. High levels of circulating growth differentiationfactor-15 have been associated with cardiovascular disease, cancer,renal dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus.
94Elevated growth differ-
entiation factor-15 has been associated with children experiencingfailure to thrive
95and is significantly higher in children with failure
to thrive and CHD compared to CHD alone.96
In adult heart failure studies, growth differentiation factor-15
levels correlate to NYHA class and can differentiate between clini-
cal heart failure staging. This is regardless of whether ejection frac-tion is reduced or preserved which may suggest a role above that ofNT-proBNP which tends to be lower in patients with preserved EFcompared to reduced EF in heart failure.
97
A study of young adult Fontan patients which assessed growth
differentiation factor-15 levels in relation to NYHA score, echofindings and NT-proBNP levels concluded that growth differentia-tion factor-15 was more useful than NT-proBNP in this cohort atidentifying reduced ejection fraction and deteriorating NYHAclass. They found that NT-proBNP was only weakly correlatedto ejection fraction and that neither NT-proBNP nor growth dif-ferentiation factor-15 were significantly related to diastolic dys-function measures. They have suggested a growth differentiationfactor-15 level of 613 pg/ml to predict EF <50% with a sensitivity
of 90% and specificity of 85.7%.
98This was supported by a similar
study focusing on growth differentiation factor-15 levels in adultCHD patients with evidence of heart failure. They found growthdifferentiation factor-15 levels correlated to NT-proBNP levels,lower exercise tolerance and increasing NYHA class. They com-mented that participants with single ventricle physiology hadhigher growth differentiation factor-15 levels than those withbiventricular physiology.
99In children with heart failure secondary to biventricular CHD
physiology, growth differentiation factor-15 levels were increasedwith increasing Ross classification and severity of heart failure.Elevated growth differentiation factor-15 levels can be used toaccurately identify participants at highest risk of adverse cardiacevents or death.
36,100,101Growth differentiation factor-15 levels cor-
related positively with NT-proBNP levels, and one study high-lighted that when used in combination with NT-proBNP andhsTnT it could be used to identify those participants at highest riskof adverse events compared to using NT-proBNP alone.
102
However, as only some of the studies directly compared diag-
nostic accuracy of NT-proBNP and growth differentiation factor-15 in paediatric heart failure, it would appear that NT-proBNPremains more sensitive and specific for those with heart failureand biventricular physiology.
21
Conclusion
Paediatric heart failure is a complex physiological state which is
influenced by underlying cardiac condition, age of patient, and sur-gical and/or medical management. The current literature has notidentified one sole biomarker which is useful in diagnosing andmonitoring heart failure in all affected children (see Table 3).
There is evidence that NT-proBNP correlates closely toechocardiogram findings and functional status for children withbiventricular physiology. Yet, the literature has described a rangeof diagnostic NT-proBNP cut-off values in this group, so it wouldrequire caution for use as a screening tool. It appears to be less reli-able in cardiomyopathy and single ventricle physiology and there-fore larger longitudinal paediatric studies are required toincorporate these patient groups and determine if biomarkerswhich reflect changes in systolic function and pressure overloadare more suitable than NT-proBNP.

ABSTRACT
Background: It is well established that folic acid prevents neural
tube defects. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, multivita-mins containing folic acid may also protect against other birth de-fects, including congenital heart defects.Objective: Our goal was to establish a maternal metabolic risk
profile for nonsyndromic congenital heart defects that would en-hance current preventive strategies.Design: Using a case-control design, we measured biomarkers of the
folate-dependent methionine and homocysteine pathway among apopulation-based sample of women whose pregnancies were af-fected by congenital heart defects (224 case subjects) or unaffectedby any birth defect (90 control subjects). Plasma concentrations offolic acid, homocysteine, methionine, S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), vitamin B-12, and adeno-
sine were compared, with control for lifestyle and sociodemographicvariables.Results: After covariate adjustment, case subjects had higher mean
concentrations of homocysteine ( P/L501410.001) and SAH ( P/L501410.001)
and lower mean concentrations of methionine ( P/L11550.019) and SAM
(P/L11550.014) than did control subjects. Vitamin B-12, folic acid, and
adenosine concentrations did not differ significantly between caseand control subjects. Homocysteine, SAH, and methionine wereidentified as the most important biomarkers predictive of case orcontrol status.Conclusions: The basis for the observed abnormal metabolic profile
among women whose pregnancies were affected by congenital heartdefects cannot be defined without further analysis of relevant geneticand environmental factors. Nevertheless, a metabolic profile that ispredictive of congenital heart defect risk would help to refine currentnutritional intervention strategies to reduce risk and may providemechanistic clues for further experimental studies.

INTRODUCTION
Congenital heart defects occur among /L5051411 per 1000 live births
in the United States (1) and are substantially more prevalentamong stillbirths and miscarriages (2). Annually, heart defectsaccount for /L505146000 total deaths and one-tenth of infant deaths (1).
Only/L5051415% of heart defects can be attributed to a known cause
(1). The remaining cases are thought to result from complexinteractions involving environmental exposures, maternal life-style factors, and genetic susceptibilities.Folic acid is well established in preventing neural tube defects
(NTDs). Evidence also suggests that multivitamins containingfolic acid may protect against congenital heart defects (3–5)However, the mechanism or mechanisms underlying this effectremain unidentified. Several studies measured plasma biomark-ers of folate metabolism among women with pregnancies af-fected by NTDs and orofacial clefts (6–10). In general, thosestudies demonstrated that increased plasma homocysteine anddecreased folic acid are detrimental to the developing embryo.
Only 2 studies reported altered concentrations of biomarkers
associated with homocysteine metabolism among women withpregnancies affected by heart defects. In one study, median fast-ing plasma homocysteine concentrations among 27 women whohad affected pregnancies were significantly higher than 56women with unaffected pregnancies (11). In the other study, fetal
cells recovered from amniotic fluid of pregnancies affected byheart defects had elevated intracellular homocysteine relative tofetal cells of unaffected pregnancies (12).
Evidence demonstrates that homocysteine is elevated among
women with a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes, includingpreeclampsia (13), recurrent early pregnancy losses (14), NTDs(6), orofacial clefts (15), and congenital heart defects (11). Ele-vated homocysteine is also associated with neurodegenerativedisorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (16–19). Homocys-teine is the product of the intracellular methionine cycle, in whichmethionine is initially activated by ATP to S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM), the primary methyl donor for essential methyltransferasereactions ( Figure 1 ). After methyl transfer, SAM is converted to
S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). The sole source of homocysteine
in the body is the hydrolysis of SAH. Interestingly, the equilibriumdynamics favor the reverse reaction, the synthesis rather than the

cause SAH to accumulate (20). Increased SAH is a potentproduct inhibitor of cellular methyltransferases, which duringorganogenesis can alter gene expression, cell differentiation,and apoptosis (21, 22).
The goal of our study was to determine whether biomarkers of
the folic acid pathway, including homocysteine and methioninemetabolism are altered among nonpregnant women who havehad a pregnancy affected by congenital heart defects comparedwith women without such a history. This may provide new in-sights into mechanisms that confer an increased risk of havingpregnancies affected by congenital heart defects.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The protocol and provisions for informed consent were re-
viewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at theUniversity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Case subjects wereidentified and ascertained through the Arkansas ReproductiveHealth Monitoring System, a statewide birth defects registry.Inclusion criteria for the case subjects were as follows: 1) resi-
dent of Arkansas at the time of the completion of the indexpregnancy and at the time of enrollment in the study; 2) preg-
nancy outcome was a liveborn, stillborn, or elective termination;3) pregnancy ended between February 1998 and September
2003; 4) a physician diagnosis of a nonsyndromic septal,
conotruncal, or right- or left-sided obstructive heart defect thatwas confirmed by prenatal or postnatal echocardiogram, surgi-cal, or autopsy report; 5) English or Spanish speaking; and 6) the
case and control subjects had completed participation in theNational Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) (23). Casesubjects for whom the pregnancy was also affected by a knownsingle gene disorder, chromosomal abnormality, or syndromewere excluded; only nonsyndromic congenital heart defects wereincluded in this study.
Control subjects were Arkansas residents who had live births
that were unaffected by any birth defect and were English orSpanish speaking. They were randomly chosen from all birthcertificates registered at the Arkansas Department of Health,with birth dates between June 1998 and February 2003. Case orcontrol subjects who were pregnant at the time of the blood drawor on antiepileptic medications were not eligible for the study.After determining eligibility for case or control subjects, a re-
search nurse contacted the subjects by mail and telephone, de-scribing this local study. During scheduled home visits, the nurseobtained written informed consent and a blood sample by routinevenipuncture.
Covariates
The maternal educational level and household income were
reported during a structured computer-assisted telephone inter-view that was specifically designed for an ongoing multisitecase-control study, the NBDPS). Further details about theNBDPS were published previously (23). At the time of the homevisit, a Block Abbreviated Food-Frequency Questionnaire (24)was administered, and information about the current use of mul-tivitamins, cigarettes, and alcohol and about caffeine intake wasobtained.
Sample preparation and biomarker measurement
Blood samples were collected into evacuated tubes containing
EDTA, immediately chilled on ice, and centrifuged at 4000 /L1154g
for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the plasma layer were transferredinto cryostat tubes and stored at /L115280 °C until analysis. Aliquots
were thawed for extraction and HPLC quantification. Plasmafolic acid and vitamin B-12 concentrations were measured byusing Quantaphase II radioimmunoassay kit from Bio-Rad Lab-oratories (Hercules, CA).
To determine total homocysteine and methionine, 50
/H9262L
freshly prepared 1.43 mol/L sodium borohydride solution con-taining 1.5
/H9262mol/L EDTA, 66 mmol/L NaOH, and 10 /H9262L iso-
amyl alcohol was added to 200 /H9262L plasma to reduce sulfhydryl
bonds. The samples were incubated at 40 °C on a shaker for 30min. To precipitate proteins, 250
/H9262L ice-cold 10% meta-
phosphoric acid was added and mixed well, and the sample wasincubated for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 18 000 gfor
15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant fluid was filtered through a0.2-
/H9262m nylon membrane filter (PGC Scientific, Frederic, MD)
and a 20- /H9262L aliquot was injected into the HPLC system.
For determination of SAM, SAH, and adenosine, 100 /H9262L 10%
meta-phosphoric acid was added to 200 /H9262L plasma to precipitate
protein; the solution was mixed well and incubated on ice for 30min. After centrifugation for 15 min at 18 000 /L1154gat 4 °C,
supernatant fluids containing SAM and SAH were passedthrough a 0.2-
/H9262m nylon membrane filter, and 20 /H9262L was injected
into the HPLC system. The methodologic details for metaboliteelution and electrochemical detection were described previously(25, 26).
Statistical analysis
Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics of case and
control subjects were compared with the Fisher exact test forcategorical variables or with the Mann-Whitney Uor Wilcoxon
rank-sum test for continuous variables. All plasma biomarkersexhibited positively skewed distributions; therefore, to achievenormality, biomarker data were log-transformed (natural log)before analysis. Normality of the transformed data was verifiedby using the Anderson-Darling test (27). Outlier analysis wasperformed for each biomarker, stratified by case-control status.Among the case subjects, 4 questionable values that fell beyond3 SDs from the mean (in both the log-transformed and untrans-formed data) were considered to be outliers. There were no out-liers identified among the control subjects.

control subjects were compared by using a Student ttest, whereas
linear regression was used to adjust these comparisons for age,race, educational level, household income, multivitamin supple-ment intake, number of cigarettes smoked daily, alcohol con-sumption, caffeine intake, and interval between the end of preg-nancy and the blood draw. Crude and adjusted odds ratios andcorresponding 95% CIs for the association between plasma bi-omarkers and case-control status were computed by using logis-tic regression. The most important predictors were identified byusing a “best subset” approach (28). Analyses were performedwith use of the SAS statistical package version 8.2 (SAS Insti-tute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Study population
Two hundred fifty-six case subjects were contacted to partic-
ipate in the study; 32 (12.5%) of the case subjects refused toparticipate. Similarly, one hundred nine control subjects werecontacted to participate in the study; 19 (17.4%) of them refusedto participate. Two case subjects had pregnancies that resulted ina stillbirth; the remaining women had affected pregnancies thatended in a live birth. Selected characteristics of the 224 casesubjects and 90 control subjects that participated in this study arepresented in Table 1 . The sample consisted primarily of white
women. At the time of the blood draw, 62.5% of the case subjectswere younger than 30 y, and less than one-half reported alcoholconsumption (45.1%). No significant difference was observedbetween the number of case subjects who reported regular mul-tivitamin use (45.1%) and the number of control subjects whoreported regular use (46.7%). Smoking was more prevalentamong case subjects (28.1%) than control subjects (16.7%; P/L1155
0.043). The mean caffeine intake did not vary significantly be-tween case subjects (44.59 mg/d) and control subjects (44.16mg/d; P/L11550.628). The median time between the end of preg-
nancy and the blood draw was significantly longer for controlsubjects (24.5 mo; range /L11554.8–49.3 mo) than for case subjects
(14.9 mo; range /L11550.1–52.2 mo; P/L501410.01). Eighty-nine (98.9%)
of the 90 control subjects and 183 (81.7%) of the 224 case sub-jects participated /L508716 mo after the end of pregnancy (data not
shown).
Biomarker analysis
Plasma concentrations for the 7 biomarkers and the SAM-to-
SAH ratio are summarized in Table 2 . All biomarker concen-
trations, except for vitamin B-12, were significantly differentbetween case and control subjects. As compared with controls,case subjects had higher mean homocysteine and SAH concen-trations and lower mean methionine and SAM concentrations.The mean folic acid concentration for case subjects was signif-icantly lower (10.33 mg/L) than for control subjects (11.99 mg/L). These biomarkers, except for plasma folic acid and adeno-sine, remained significant at the 5% level after adjusting for age,race, educational level, household income, smoking, multivita-min intake, alcohol consumption, caffeine intake, and time be-tween the end of pregnancy and blood draw. Similar results wereobtained when the outliers were included in the analysis.
Multiple linear logistic regression models stratified by multi-
vitamin use were fitted to identify the simultaneous effect of thebiomarkers on case or control status ( Table 3 ). All models were
adjusted for the mother’s level of education, number of cigarettessmoked daily, and interval between the end of pregnancy and theblood draw. The SAM:SAH was not included in the model be-cause of collinearity with SAM and SAH. When all subjects,regardless of their multivitamin use, were analyzed together,plasma homocysteine, SAH, and, to a lesser extent, methioninewere identified as the most important predictive biomarkers bythe best-subset selection method. None of the biomarkers weresignificantly different in multivitamin users than in nonusers(data not shown).
The concentrations of homocysteine, methionine, and SAH
were compared between case and control subjects by computingcrude odds ratios at various cutoffs on the basis of biomarkerpercentiles within controls ( Table 4 ). Of the 224 case subjects,
137 (61.2%) had homocysteine concentrations above the 70thpercentile of control subjects, and 31.7% had concentrationsTABLE 1

the right (higher values) in the plasma homocysteine distributionof case subjects relative to control subjects. The distribution ofplasma SAH values in case subjects was also shifted to the rightwith respect to control subjects: 103 case subjects (46.2%) hadplasma SAH concentrations above the 70th percentile of SAHconcentrations in control subjects, and 13.5% had concentrationsabove the 95th percentile of control subjects. Conversely, thedistribution of plasma methionine in case subjects was shifted tothe left (lower values) with respect to control subjects. Eighty-sixcases (38.6%) had methionine concentrations below the 20thpercentile of methionine concentrations in control subjects, and17.9% had concentrations below the 5th percentile of controlsubjects.

mocysteine and SAH were elevated, and concentrations of SAM,methionine, and SAM:SAH were reduced among case subjects.There were no significant differences in folate, vitamin B-12, oradenosine between case and control subjects. The 95th percentile
homocysteine concentration among women aged 20–39 y in thethird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey samplewas 10.4
/H9262g/L. In our sample, 34.4% of case subjects and 5.6%
of control subjects had greater homocysteine concentrations
(29). The factors contributing to this abnormal maternal meta-bolic profile are unclear, as are the effects on cardiac develop-ment.
Possible causes for the altered biomarkers include deficiencies
in folate or vitamin B-12 or both, genetic polymorphisms encod-ing enzymes in the methionine cycle, or exogenous factors. Meanplasma folic acid was not significantly lower among case sub-jects than control subjects, as would be expected if folate defi-ciency was strongly contributing. Most pregnancies in this studybegan after January 1, 1998, when folic acid fortification of grainproducts was mandated (30). The mean folic acid concentrationamong our control subjects was 11.99 mg/L (31), which is con-sistent with the mean postfortification concentrations amongwomen of childbearing age in other studies (32).
The similarity in folic acid concentrations between case and
control subjects suggest that case subjects were either more ge-netically susceptible to having increases in homocysteine andSAH or were more likely to have reduced activity of relevantenzymes. For example, an alteration in the function of, or genesencoding, methionine synthase may reduce the conversion ofhomocysteine to methionine (Figure 1). Multiple case-controlstudies have evaluated the association between NTDs and com-mon genetic variants in the methionine synthase gene with in-consistent results (33–36). To our knowledge, the associationbetween methionine synthase activity and congenital heart de-fects is as yet undetermined. Thus, further studies are needed ofgenetic variants associated with congenital heart defects thatwould cause elevated homocysteine.
Our findings of elevated homocysteine among case subjects
are consistent with other studies comparing vitamin-dependenthomocysteine metabolism among mothers of offspring with oro-facial clefts (15) and NTDs (6) with those of mothers with non-malformed offspring (15). Studies have also found elevated ho-mocysteine concentrations in women who have hadpreeclampsia (13) and recurrent early miscarriages (14). In thosestudies, maternal vitamin and homocysteine concentrations were

Thus, it was not possible to determine whether alterations inbiomarkers among nonpregnant women having adverse preg-nancy outcomes reflect the biomarker concentrations during or-ganogenesis or early pregnancy loss. However, it is known thattemporal changes in homocysteine concentrations are minimalover a 1–2-y time frame (37). Also, we are unable to determinethe temporal relation between the alteration in biomarkers andthe adverse pregnancy from our findings and those of others. Theevidence suggests that these alterations, if not causally related,are associated with an increased risk of having adverse preg-nancy outcomes, including congenital heart defects.
Possible mechanisms by which homocysteine may have an
embryotoxic effect include oxidative stress and secondary accu-mulation of SAH, which leads to product inhibition of DNAmethyltransferase reactions, DNA hypomethylation, and alteredgene expression (38). Lifestyle factors such as alcohol intake andcigarette smoking are associated with increased oxidative stress(39), which can decrease the functional activity of methioninesynthase through limiting the availability of reduced vitaminB-12 (35, 40, 41). Of note in our sample is the greater number ofsmokers among case subjects than among control subjects. Whenhomocysteine concentration was stratified by smoking statusamong case and control subjects, the differences were higheramong smokers than nonsmokers in both the case and the controlsubjects, but the results were not significantly different (data notshown). Animal studies showed that oxidative stress during fetalorganogenesis can result in damage to mitochondrial and nuclearDNA, to protein structure and function, or to membrane lipidsand signal transduction pathways. Depending on the timing andduration of exposure, the functional consequences of oxidativeinjury are embryopathy and dysmorphogenesis. For example,exposure of rats to 20% oxygen during early neurulation signif-icantly increased the incidence of NTDs relative to unexposedembryos (42). Hypomethylation also was shown to lead to em-bryonic lethality and multiple developmental malformations (43,44). For example, maternal exposure to valproic acid was shownto induce DNA hypomethylation in NTD-affected pregnancies
in mice (45).
Several methodologic limitations of our study should be con-
sidered. Despite efforts to enroll participants soon after the indexpregnancy, the venipuncture occurred well after the index preg-nancies had ended. Thus, our measurements may not representthe biomarker concentrations at the time of organogenesis. How-ever, it is remarkable that, even far after delivery, the biomarkersmeasured are significantly different between case and controlsubjects.
Given the relatively rare prevalence of most birth defects, the
most common epidemiologic design used to investigate etiologicfactors is a case-control study after the completion of pregnancy.Substantially more resources would be required to launch a co-hort study to measure biomarkers among women enrolled beforeconception and followed to the completion of pregnancy. How-ever, confidence in our findings is supported by noting that al-though folate, vitamin B-12 (46), and homocysteine (47) grad-ually decrease during pregnancy, at 6 wk after delivery, theconcentrations are similar to those before conception or earlypregnancy (47). Further, we examined our data to determinewhether concentrations of homocysteine and folate correlatedwith the time interval between the end of pregnancy and the blooddraw in case and control subjects. No discernible trend was
found. Therefore, it is likely that, on average, the metabolicpatterns observed even more than a year after pregnancy reflectstable adult profiles.
We did not examine the relation between cardiac phenotypes
and the biomarkers. Particular cardiac phenotypes may be moreinfluenced by altered homocysteine and methionine metabolismby way of different developmental pathways. Another potentialsource of bias in our study could be the failure to identify cardiaclesions among control pregnancies. Although control subjectswere excluded if the medical chart indicated any congenital mal-formation, echocardiograms were not required to rule out a car-diac lesion.TABLE 4

tered metabolic profile might provide a measure of preconcep-tional risk and, more importantly, new information for the re-finement of nutritional intervention strategies designed to reducerisk. Currently, primary prevention efforts to reduce the occur-rence of nonsyndromic congenital heart defects are limited tofolic acid fortification and supplementation and to avoidance ofspecific teratogens. Clinical efforts are focused on secondaryprevention by using fetal echocardiograms, thereby optimizingpostnatal medical and surgical outcomes. Identification of thegenetic, epigenetic, and metabolic factors that may increase thelikelihood of having a pregnancy affected by congenital heartdefects may enhance primary prevention. One might imaginethat during routine gynecologic visits women are screened forcancer, sexually transmitted diseases, and an increased risk ofadverse pregnancy outcomes. Such screening would only behelpful if effective interventions to modify the risk profile wereavailable. Currently, a national effort is under way to identifybiomarkers for cancer risk and prevention (48). Perhaps, it is nowtime to begin a similar effort for the primary prevention of birthdefects.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) accounts for nearly one-third of all major congenital anomalies. CHD birth prevalence
worldwide and over time is suggested to vary; however, a complete overview is missing. This systematic review in-cluded 114 papers, comprising a total study population of 24,091,867 live births with CHD identiﬁed in 164,396 indi-viduals. Birth prevalence of total CHD and the 8 most common subtypes were pooled in 5-year time periods since1930 and in continent and income groups since 1970 using the inverse variance method. Reported total CHD birthprevalence increased substantially over time, from 0.6 per 1,000 live births (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.4 to 0.8)in 1930 to 1934 to 9.1 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 9.0 to 9.2) after 1995. Over the last 15 years, stabilization oc-curred, corresponding to 1.35 million newborns with CHD every year. Signiﬁcant geographical differences were found.Asia reported the highest CHD birth prevalence, with 9.3 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 8.9 to 9.7), with relativelymore pulmonary outﬂow obstructions and fewer left ventricular outﬂow tract obstructions. Reported total CHD birthprevalence in Europe was signiﬁcantly higher than in North America (8.2 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 8.1 to 8.3] vs.6.9 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 6.7 to 7.1]; p /H110210.001). Access to health care is still limited in many parts of the
world, as are diagnostic facilities, probably accounting for differences in reported birth prevalence between high- andlow-income countries. Observed differences may also be of genetic, environmental, socioeconomical, or ethnic origin, andthere needs to be further investigation to tailor the management of this global health problem.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause
of major congenital anomalies, representing a major globalhealth problem. Twenty-eight percent of all major congen-ital anomalies consist of heart defects (1). Reported birthprevalence of CHD varies widely among studies worldwide.
The estimate of 8 per 1,000 live births is generally accepted asthe best approximation (2 ). CHD, by deﬁnition, is present
from birth. The most practical measurement of CHD occur-rence is birth prevalence per 1,000 live births (3 ).
Massive breakthroughs have been achieved in cardiovas-
cular diagnostics and cardiothoracic surgery over the pastcentury, leading to an increased survival of newborns withCHD. Consequently, more patients with CHD reachadulthood, creating a completely new and steadily growingpatient population: patients with grown-up congenital heartdisease (GUCH). The prevalence of CHD is estimated tobe 4 per 1,000 adults (4). Patients with GUCH often needlong-term expert medical care and healthcare-related costsare high (5). Therefore, the global health burden as a result
of CHD increases quickly.
It is important to have reliable information about world-

Variation in CHD occurrencesover time and worldwide has been suggested, but a completeoverview is missing. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we provide a complete worldwide overview of thereported birth prevalence of total CHD and the 8 mostcommon subtypes of CHD from 1930 until 2010.

original research papers with Eng-lish abstracts. No time restrictionfor publication dates was used. Re-ports of large governmental birthregistries were searched online.
All titles and abstracts were
screened for study population(live births, children), type ofCHD, and birth prevalence. Stud-ies were eligible if they reportedthe birth prevalence of total CHDor 1 of the 8 most common CHDsubtypes: ventricular septal defect(VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD),pulmonary stenosis (PS), patentductus arteriosus (PDA), tetral-ogy of Fallot (TOF), coarctation(Coarc), transposition of the greatarteries (TGA), and aortic stenosis(AoS). CHD was deﬁned accord-
ing to the deﬁnition of Mitchell et al. (6 ); namely, “a gross
structural abnormality of the heart or intrathoracic great vesselsthat is actually or potentially of functional signiﬁcance.” Thisdeﬁnition excludes PDA in premature infants, Marfan syn-drome, bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse, cardiomy-opathies, and congenital arrhythmias. Papers studying onlyspeciﬁc groups (e.g., only Down syndrome), rheumatic heartdisease, or case studies of rare defects were excluded. Papersfocusing on etiology, (pre-natal) diagnosis, treatment, progno-sis, or animal research were also excluded.
After exclusion on the basis of the title and abstract, full
papers were carefully read and reconsidered according to allabovementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studiesfocusing on CHD prevalence in schoolchildren age /H110225
years or including only severe forms of CHD were excluded.When a study was eligible for inclusion, we veriﬁed thedenominator and numerator and recalculated the estimatedbirth prevalence to check accuracy. Studies with incorrect ormissing denominators or numerator were excluded. Threeauthors performed the search independently using theseinclusion and exclusion criteria. In case of disagreement, anagreement was negotiated. References of selected paperswere crosschecked with the same inclusion and exclusioncriteria.Data extraction. Selected papers were reviewed and study
characteristics were tabulated in a MS Excel for Windows(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) and Re-view Manager version 5.0 (Review Manager, The NordicCochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenha-gen, Denmark). The following study characteristics wereregistered: time period during which the study was per-formed, country, study design (retrospective or prospective),age of patients, diagnostic method, number of live births,number of patients with CHD, and birth prevalence of totalCHD and 8 CHD subtypes. Studies were grouped accord-ing to 5-year time periods since 1930 to demonstrate timetrends. Time period is taken as the period in which thestudy was performed. Before 1970, many differences inavailability of diagnostic and registration facilities betweenthe continents existed, so we used only those studiesperformed after 1970 to compare continents and incomegroups. World Bank Income groups based on gross nationalincome per capita in 2008 were deﬁned as: low income(/H11349$975), lower-middle-income ($976 to $3,855), upper-middle-income ($3,856 to 11,905), and high income(/H11350$11,906) (7).Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done in Re-
view manager 5.0, MS Excel, and SPPS version 15.0 (SPSS,Chicago, Illinois). Birth prevalence of total CHD and the 8most common subtypes were pooled using the inversevariance method. Pooled group estimates were comparedwith a chi-square test. Time trends were plotted by usingthe Savitzky-Golay smoothing technique. Heterogeneity onbasis of study design (retrospective vs. prospective), studysize, continents, income groups and time periods wasexplored by using the Q and the I
2statistics and by means
of funnel plots.
Results
Search results. The systematic literature search yielded
1,136 potential eligible studies. After exclusion, cross-
referencing, and reaching agreement on 3 studies, 114studies were included in this systematic literature review andmeta-analysis (Fig. 1, Online Table 1). This resulted in atotal study population of 24,091,867 live births with CHDidentiﬁed in 164,396 individuals. There were 12 reports ofprospective birth defect registries. Seventy-six studies usedechocardiography as the main diagnostic tool; the rest usedcombinations of diagnostic tools, such as death certiﬁcates,autopsy and surgical reports, physical examination, x-rays,and catheterization.Total CHD birth prevalence. Over time, the reported
total CHD birth prevalence increased substantially (Fig. 2),from 0.6 per 1,000 live births (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]:0.4 to 0.8) in 1930 to 1934 to 9.1 per 1,000 live births (95%CI: 9.0 to 9.2) after 1995. The increase over time wasS-shaped, with a ﬁrst steep increase from 1930 to 1960,followed by stabilization around 5.3 per 1,000 live birthsfrom 1961 to 1975, a second steep increase from the late1970s until 1995, and eventually stabilization around 9.1 per1,000 live births in the last 15 years.
Signiﬁcant geographical differences were found ( Fig. 3A).
The highest reported total CHD birth prevalence was foundin Asia (9.3 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 8.9 to 9.7]) andthe lowest in Africa (1.9 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 1.1to 3.5]). Reported total CHD birth prevalence in Asia wassigniﬁcantly higher compared with all other continents (all,p/H110210.001). Europe had the second highest reported total
CHD birth prevalence (8.2 per 1,000 live births [95% CI:8.1 to 8.3]).Abbreviations

Birth Prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease November 15, 2011:2241–7 Signiﬁcant differences between World Bank income
groups were found (Fig. 3B), with the highest reported total
CHD birth prevalence in high-income countries (8.0 per1,000 live births [95% CI: 7.9 to 8.1]; all, p /H110210.001).
Reported total CHD birth prevalence in upper- middle-income countries was 7.3 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 6.9to 7.7) and 6.9 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 6.1 to 7.7) inlower-middle-income countries (p /H110050.013). No data from
low-income countries were available.Birth prevalence of the 8 most common subtypes ofCHD. Reported birth prevalence of the 8 most common
CHD subtypes since 1945 is shown in Figure 4. Distribu-
tion of the 8 most common CHD subtypes worldwide isshown with percentages in Figure 5. Worldwide reported
birth prevalence of the CHD subtypes (per 1,000 live births)was: VSD, 2.62 (95% CI: 2.59 to 2.65); ASD, 1.64 (95%CI: 1.61 to 1.67); PDA, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83 to 0.91); PS,0.50 (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.52); TOF, 0.34 (95% CI: 0.31 to0.37); Coarc, 0.34 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.36); TGA, 0.31 (95%CI: 0.28 to 0.34); and AoS, 0.22 (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.24).
Signiﬁcant geographical differences in reported birth
prevalence of the 8 most common CHD subtypes weredetected (Fig. 5). Asia reported relatively more pulmonaryoutﬂow obstructions (PS and TOF) and fewer left ventric-ular outﬂow tract obstructions (Coarc and AoS). Further-more, Asia reported a lower TGA birth prevalence com-pared with Europe, North America, South America, andOceania (p /H110210.001).1136 articles

Birth Prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease November 15, 2011:2241–7 tially, from /H110211 per 1,000 live births in 1930 to 9 per 1,000
live births in recent years. With a worldwide annual birth
rate around 150 million births (8), this corresponds to 1.35million live births with CHD every year, representing amajor public health issue.
The increase in reported total CHD birth prevalence over
time may be caused by changes in diagnostic methods andscreening modalities rather than representing a true in-crease. Over the past century, knowledge about diagnostics
and treatment of CHD increased considerably. Survivalincreased dramatically due to improvements in the ﬁeld ofcardiothoracic surgery and anesthesia. Specialized pediatriccardiologists were trained, and large prospective birth defectregistries became available. Before the era of echocardiog-raphy, detection of CHD was dependent on autopsy re-ports, death certiﬁcates, physical examination, x-rays, cath-eterization, and surgical reports. Therefore, only severelyaffected subjects could be detected. In the 1970s, echocar-diography was widely introduced into clinical practice,making it possible to also diagnose asymptomatic patients aswell as patients with mild lesions (9). This developmentprobably explains the increased birth prevalence of totalCHD in the 1970s, as well as the increase in speciﬁc groups,
such as patients with VSD, ASD, and PDA. Furthermore,
echocardiography currently is often used as a screening toolbefore (noncardiac) surgery or full assessment in case of
noncardiac disease, causing an increase in diagnoses of minorlesions such as a small VSD or ASD. Our results conﬁrmﬁndings from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital DefectsProgram that routine use of echocardiography has increaseddiagnosis of minor defects (10). The relative stability of theestimation of birth prevalence of complex CHD subtypes alsoargues for a merely methodological increase.
Nonetheless, there are arguments that not only the
reported but also the true CHD birth prevalence changed
over time. Survival of premature infants has improved overthe last century, attributing to an increase in total CHD andespecially VSD birth prevalence (4). Because increasingnumbers of women in developed countries are delayingchildbearing to an older age, maternal age has increased inthe last decades, consequently causing a higher birth prev-alence of congenital abnormalities (11,12). In addition, thepatient population with GUCH is steadily increasing andtheir offspring is at increased risk of having a congenitalabnormality (13). Furthermore, one might hypothesize that
changes in environmental exposures—for example, due toindustrialization and urbanization—over the past centuryhave had effects on CHD birth prevalence.

November 15, 2011:2241–7 Birth Prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease sures, vitamin A use, marijuana use, and exposure to organic
solvents have been proven to be associated with increasedrisk of CHD (14). Exposure to ionizing radiation in
occupational settings or in clinical practice did not show anyassociations with CHD birth prevalence (14). Data aboutalcohol consumption, hard drugs, or cigarette smoking
during pregnancy are insufﬁcient to determine risk forCHD. The impact of increased use of fetal echocardiogra-phy and pregnancy termination on reduction of CHD birthprevalence is expected in the next time periods (15).
Furthermore, in the upcoming decades we will probably seethe effect of improving ﬁgures on infant survival andsocioeconomical circumstances in developing countries onCHD birth prevalence.Geographical and income group differences in CHDbirth prevalence. Important geographical differences were
found. Asia reported the highest total CHD birth preva-lence (9.3 per 1,000 live births). This ﬁnding could in partbe attributed to high consanguinity rates in some studypopulations (e.g., in Iran and India) (16,17). CHD birthprevalence among children with consanguineous parentswas found to be considerably higher than in nonconsan-guineous parents, suggesting an important genetic inﬂuence(16). Very interesting is the relatively high birth prevalenceof pulmonary outﬂow tract obstructions (PS and TOF) andlow birth prevalence of left ventricular outﬂow tract obstruc-tions (Coarc and AoS) in Asia. These ﬁndings conﬁrm theresults of Jacobs et al. (18), who found that white childrenseem to have more left ventricular obstructive lesions,whereas Chinese children have more right ventricular out-ﬂow tract lesions. A possible explanation could be found in
genetic origin.
Interestingly, Europe had the second highest reported
total CHD birth prevalence. The difference between Eu-rope and North America (8.2 vs. 6.9 per 1,000 live births;p/H110210.001) was unexpected because the study populations
and design of the studies in these 2 continents are quite
comparable. This difference might be attributed to ethnic,socioeconomical, and environmental differences. NorthAmerica has a relatively larger population of African-American inhabitants and, as previously described, CHD isless common in this population (19). Part of the differencemight also be explained by differences in healthcare andreferral systems. In the United States, as was noted in theBaltimore-Washington Infant Study (20), referral of infantswith developmental abnormalities, such as Down syndromeand other trisomies, for cardiac evaluation can be inhibited,whereas these societal factors probably are of less impor-tance in most European countries. Moreover, the fact thatwe found important differences in CHD birth prevalenceaccording to income status also argues in favor of the factthat lack of resources, medical insurance, screening pro-grams, and referral systems probably lead to an underesti-mation of the true birth prevalence.Heterogeneity in this meta-analysis. Obviously, reported
birth CHD prevalence reﬂects the true CHD birth preva-
lence but also depends on the study design of the originalpapers, study population selection, and diagnostic toolsused. CHD prevalence highly depends on age and gesta-tional age. For example, PDA in preterm babies is a0.000.501.001.502.002.503.00

Birth Prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease November 15, 2011:2241–7 functional abnormality, whereas it is an abnormality in term
infants (21). Furthermore, CHD prevalence highly dependson the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the detection method.Differences in study population selection and inclusion andexclusion criteria of included studies attributed to hetero-geneity in this meta-analysis. Tests for heterogeneityshowed high heterogeneity in continents, income groups,and time periods, but this ﬁnding can be explained by thefact that, due to the very large sample sizes, point estimateswere very precise and SEs very small, and therefore heter-ogeneity was expected and inevitable. We did not ﬁnd biascaused by the design (prospective or retrospective nature) orsize of included studies.Study limitations. Even though we investigated all avail-
able reports of total CHD and CHD subtype birth preva-lence worldwide, checked for bias caused by study design,and adjusted comparisons to the era of echocardiography,some residual bias may be present in our estimates (e.g.,caused by differences in quality of the papers). It remainsdifﬁcult, as stated by others, to determine whether detecteddifferences in CHD birth prevalence are real or merelymethodological (22). Another inevitable limitation of thismeta-analysis is that it does not really cover the entire worldpopulation. Data from developing countries were scarce,and studies often do not include indigenous inhabitants andtribes. Population-wide prospective birth defect registriesare necessary to determine the true birth prevalence, includ-ing economically developing parts of the world.
Conclusions
Reported total CHD birth prevalence increased substan-
tially over the last century, reaching a stable estimate of 9per 1,000 live births in the last 15 years. This corresponds to1.35 million newborns with CHD every year, representing amajor global health burden. Signiﬁcant geographical differ-ences were found. It remains uncertain whether detecteddifferences in CHD birth prevalence represent true ormerely methodological differences. In the future, the etiol-ogy of CHD needs to be further clariﬁed and population-wide prospective birth defect registries covering the entireworld population are needed to determine the exact birthprevalence.

Congenital heart diseases are substantially appeared before or after 
birth. There are two important disease categories which are commonly 
appeared in after birth vascular, congenital heart disease. Right 
ventricular hypertrophy is one of important congenital heart disease. 
These abnormalities are related to either structure or function of heart 
and also found associated to cardiovascular system. In principle these 
are recognizable in early life and are observed in 7-12 of every 1000 
live births. But it is of all the trivial lesions which are recognized 
in early child hood. During infancy 50-60 per cent of these patients 
need medical and surgical help, among total non-treated patients only 
10-15 per cent get survive without surgery to adolescence and adult 
life. These are known as natural survivors whose congenital defects or 
disease modify with the time and face post natal changes and remain 
abnormal. Prevalence of these diseases show lower child survival 
index that display basal infant and child mortality under the age of 
5years. Besides, children congenital heart diseases, adult congenital 
heart diseases are reported to increasing alarmingly. Though there 
are hundreds of congenital defects and few of them come in rare 
categories. 
Tetralogy of Fallot1 is, neonatal lupus or congenital heart block a 
significant health problems whose pathogenesis is quite complex.2 
Similarly, end-stage heart failure and abnormalities of bicuspid 
aortic valve are also congenital3 (Table 1). Prominent intrapulmonary 
anastomotic vessels or bronchopulmonary shunt vessels is also 
reported in lungs from infants with fatal congenital diaphragmatic 
hernia Down syndrome is the most common viable chromosomal 
disorder with intellectual impairment and several other developmental 
abnormalities. Forty to fifty percent of newborns with down syndrome 
have some form of congenital heart defects.4 Endocardial fibroelastosis 
is a unique form of fibrosis, which forms a de novo sub-endocardial 
tissue layer encapsulating the myocardium and stunting its growth, is 
typically associated with congenital heart diseases of heterogeneous 
origin, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome.5Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a serious complication of 
adult congenital heart disease associated with systemic-to-pulmonary 
shunts and shows markedly increased morbidity and mortality in 
infants.6 Although early shunt closure restricts development of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension, but patients remain at risk even after 
repair. Hyperuricaemia is associated with traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia and shows higher 
mortality (Table 2). An aneurysm is a local dilatation of a vessel wall 
which is >50% of its original diameter. Aortic aneurysms are among 
the most challenging to treat.7 Similarly, early stage heart failure in 
adults is a severe congenital heart disease remains elusive in diagnosis 
(Table 1). Many ACHD ( Adult Congenital Heart Disease) patients 
seem well-compensated owing to chronic physical and psychological 
adaptations, but these remain abnormal even after post surgery they 
report stable health and good quality of life.8 
Biomarkers are important tools which are used for assessment of 
disorder or disease, its clinical diagnosis, prognosis, recurrence and 
possible therapeutics. These are indicators of a biological state and 
can detect alterations in the constituents of tissues or body fluids 
more promptly and accurately. Before treatment establishment of 
cause of deformity and its types should be established to recognize 
high risk groups among patients. Biomarkers are used to explore 
specific defects, and assist in management of postoperative cardiac 
patients facing congenital heart diseases.9 However, by measuring 
levels of important molecules in patient’s tissue fluids clinicians can 
analyze and interpret results to identify congenital heart disease and 
its possible therapeutics.10 For example to establish left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction a test with LR + and LR- negative is used to 
predict the level of risk. Similarly tests based on urine N-terminal 
pro-BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) (N-BNP) test is also followed by a 
plasma N-BNP test that can facilitate screening for asymptomatic left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction in CHD patients. Mainly estimations 
of bio-molecules in body fluids are used for predicting the prognosis 
of patients with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and dilated

Present review aims to discuss new emerging biomarkers that could facilitate authentic 
and fast diagnosis of congenital heart diseases. The population of congenital heart 
disease patients is increasing regularly and serious complications in adults are also 
enormously exceeding in comparison to children. Most of these congenital defects are 
un-curable and becoming challenging to treat. However, for predicting the prognosis 
of patient’s different types of biomarkers i.e. hemodynamic, physiological, genetic, 
molecular, immunological, clinical and therapeutic biomarkers are explained. For 
sequential assessment of major structural and functional defects in CHD (congenital 
heart diseases) patients various bioassays and scientific methods are used to integrate 
defects with symptoms to find therapeutic decisions, targets and goals. This article 
tries to explore therapeutic options and solutions of CHD on the basis of emerging 
biomarkers and assess the need to advent new potential authentic biomarkers.

Hemodynamic or cardiac biomarkers or blood bio -
markers
Most congenital heart diseases have specific hemodynamics, 
including volume and pressure overload. However, by using cardiac 
biomarkers cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, associated 
with anatomical abnormalities can be established. Hemodynamic 
abnormalities can cause activation of neuro hormones, inflammatory 
cytokines, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells, which in turn contribute to the development of pathological conditions such 
as cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac cell damages and 
death. Cardiac biomarkers facilitate the prediction of pathological 
changes that could provide information about the stress placed on 
the myocardial cells, the severity of the damage, the responses of 
neuro humoral factors, and the remodeling of the ventricle (Table 
2). Moreover, assessment of cardiac biomarkers at an earlier stage 
can reduce the myocardial damage and severity of heart failure.11 
Therefore, children with CHD need most appropriate and delicate 
care12 (Table 2).

Physiological markers
Measurement of HDL-C(High-density lipoprotein cholesterol), 
Interleukin (IL-6, 10), 6-hydroxymelatonin, galectin-3 and plasma 
B-type natriuretic peptide low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, 
ischaemic stress and reactive oxygen species, folic acid, vitamin 
B12 are potential physiological biomarkers which can predict the 
risk of congenital heart diseases.12 These are also based on levels of 
homocysteine , hydrogen sulfide, and C-reactive protein in serum 
samples of children, In addition, atrio-ventricular and cardiac muscle 
contraction, ionic interaction and troponin activity are also important 
physiological markers. Similarly, risk prediction algorithms and 
vascular risk prediction rules and statistical scores can assess the 
risk of death or stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and early 
age atherosclerosis. Further, oxygen transport between patients with 
restrictive right ventricle and those without right ventricle decides 
CHD in children13 Serum kinetics in children is also used to identify 
atrial and ventricular septal defects closure in terms of extracorporeal 
circulation. C-reactive protein demonstrates functional status of 
cardiac muscle functional status. Its level can predict clinical outcome 
and mortality in adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated 
with congenital heart disease. Single CRP assessment is also used 
to diagnose antibiotics abuse14 and find out significant differences 
between cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart disease patients 
(Table 2). Children with CHD have shown elevated levels of 
inflammatory cytokines, caspase 3, troponin T, and CKMB which also 
display cardiac health or abnormality. However, by measuring tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vasoendothelial growth 
factor, troponin T, creatin kinase MB, and Caspase 3 levels congenital 
defects can be established in children.15 In addition troponin I; matrix 
metalloproteinase-2; urokinase plasminogen activator; urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; plasminogen; and vitamin D in body 
fluids can establish CHD related inflammation, fibrosis and cardiac 
dysfunction.16
For routine coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment serum 
biomarker specifically associated and based on baseline level of 
triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), body mass index, 
albumin, geriatric nutritional risk index, normalized protein catabolic 
rate, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are 
used. Following CRP and NT-proBNP levels after birth can potentially 
monitor severity and progression of cardiac neonatal lupus.16 Similarly, 
plasma C-terminal fibrinogen growth factor 23, fasting glucose and 
insulin level with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein recognize birth 
related vascular defects in children (Table 2).17 Baseline hemoglobin 
A1c level can accurately predict heart failures due to baseline cardiac 
structural and functional abnormalities. Right heart dysfunction, 
endothelial inflammation and proliferation can be diagnosed by 
measuring plasma levels. Similarly, plasma BNP measurements can 
differentiate congenital heart disease and lung disease and can be used 
to monitor the effects of treatment for infants with heart failure.18
Serum--myocardial fraction of creatine kinase and galectin-3 is 
used as biochemical marker for finding myocardial injury. However, 
increased serum concentration can help to find out clinical and 
paraclinical requirement of CHD children.19 Similarly, Cystatin C 
and serum creatinine level is used to establish acute kidney injury 
in children with congenital heart disease.2 Cystatin C is a better 
glomerular filtration rate marker than serum creatinine.20 Moreover, 
association of cardiac biomarkers  (N-type pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide, creatine kinase-MB , heart-type fatty acid binding protein, 
and troponins I and T can also diagnose postoperative AKI.21 Emerging biomarkers of congenital heart diseases and disorders112

DOI: 10.15406/jsrt.2016.01.00021However, level of certain mediators of neuro hormonal activation 
such as B-type natriuretic peptide and its N-terminal-pro-fragment, and 
vascular endothelial growth factor are used for diagnosing pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with congenital heart disease. 
Acute phase proteins, haptoglobin, SAP, and orosomucoid 2 change 
display Ventricular septal defect patients show intra-cardiac left-to-
right shunt and increased pulmonary flow that may affect the acute 
phase response.22 High-sensitive troponin-T is used for diagnosing 
acute coronary syndrome, in congenital heart disease patients and 
to display myocardial damage related to NT-proBNP and ventricular 
function, its potential predictive value in ACHD patients is promising.23 
Similarly, lower levels of plasma NGAL differentiate patients with 
complex congenital heart disease and cyanotic congenital heart 
disease. Similarly, combined prognostic value of plasma NGAL 
with plasma NT-proBNP in adult patients can predict congenital 
heart disease24 and cardiovascular deaths.25 Differential metabolic 
components (blood pressures) and metabolic pathway network can be 
used as potential biomarkers for hypertension.26 Surfactant protein B 
plasma levels may help to diagnose patients with cardiac problems 
diminishing the alveolocapillary membrane stability (Table 2). More 
specifically, plasma levels can be measured in the preoperative and 
postoperative periods.24
Genetic markers
Genetic biomarkers are DNA sequences in gene which are 
responsible for disease or associated with susceptibility to disease. 
SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) demonstrate significant 
variations among genes and are used to find risk stratification for 
ventricular arrhythmias in survivors of acute coronary syndromes and 
arrhythmic events after ACS (antireticular cytotoxic serum).27 Similarly, 
differential expression of HUB genes i.e. UBC, APP, HUWE1 and 
SRC display both congenital disorders and congenital heart defects 
in newborns (CHD) and are established genetic markers.4 Similarly, 
sequencing of important neonatal genes and its expression in tissues 
can help in identification of cardiac disorders (both syndromic and 
nonsyndromic disorders).28 Similarly, abnormal karyotype can work 
as good marker for establishing fetal congenital heart disease during 
pregnancy. More functional genetic markers are copy number 
variations, single gene mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms 
are responsible for the development of CHD.28 Aneuploidy, or 
abnormal chromosomal number, is also one of the important reasons 
of CHD. Normally, most of the CHD cases were observed in new 
born associating with some chromosomal abnormality.29 Fifty percent 
of cases born with Trisomy 21 have CHD mainly displaying either 
atrial or ventricular septal defects to atrioventricular canal lesions. 
Similarly, Trisomy 18, bear CHD, more usually in the form of septal 
defects. Approximately one-third of females with Turner syndrome, 
or monosomy X, have CHD. Approximately one-third of females 
with Turner syndrome, or monosomy X, have CHD. In such cases 
chromosomal defects in patients with CHD can be detected by using 
chromosomal G-banded karyotype. Klinefelter syndrome males who 
display 47 chromosomes (XXY), showed fifty percent incidences 
of CHD i.e ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defects.29 However, 
different types of chromosomal abnormalities can be established by 
using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In this technique 
fluorescent labeled probes are hybridized to study metaphase 
chromosomes to detect small submicroscopic chromosomal deletions 
and duplications. FISH technique is used to establish cause of several 
syndromes caused by chromosomal abnormalities and associating with CHDs. Microscopic deletion on chromosome can reveal fact 
about occurrence of most common cardiac malformations such as 
interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, and tetralogy of Fallot, and 
routine with genetic testing.30 The cardio-vascular defects due to any 
syndrome can be traced by identifying loss of elastin due to mutations 
that causes supravalvar aortic stenosis.31,32 Similar abnormalities can 
be identified by measuring alpha II-spectrin breakdown products 
in the serum.33 Non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) is emerging as new 
fundamental regulators of gene expression (Table 2). microRNAs and 
lncRNAs work as clinical biomarkers for aortic aneurysm.7
Immunological biomarkers
Interleukin-6, 174 GC polymorphism and C-reactive protein 
can recognize idiopathic cardiac arrhythmias in children.34 
Similarly, ratio between specific anti-52 Ro/SSA-p200 antibodies 
displays congenital heart block.35 It is used to identify mothers at higher 
risk to deliver affected children. ICAM-1 is a potential biomarker 
to be used for the diagnosis and follow-up of pulmonary artery 
hypertension (Table 2).36 Other important immunological biomarkers 
which could provide better specificity about CHD are levels of 
different cytokines, chemokines, circulating antigens, antibodies in 
serum and constitutively expressed natural auto antibodies (na-Ab) 
which interact specifically with different self-antigens and plurality of 
anti-self receptors of auto reactive T-lymphocytes.
Molecular markers
Molecular biomarkers based on presence of circulating miRNA 
expression profilesare used to predict congenital heart diseases 
mainly for clinical diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
associated abnormalities.37 Congenital heart disease patients show 
high levels of natriuretic peptide (NP) in comparison to normal 
controls. Similarly, levels of norepinephrine found altered in 
symptomatic patients, especially those with unrepaired congenital 
heart disease, Eisenmenger syndrome, pulmonary hypertension and 
adult congenital heart failure.38 These are used as, molecular markers 
for prediction of congenital heart disease.39 Similarly, level ofTBX5 
a transcription factor diagnose embryonic cardiac defects.40 Its 2.77 
and 3.51 times higher levels of miR-10a and miR-10b expression in 
the heart tissues display congenital heart diseases. Similarly, levels of 
-fatty acid-binding protein, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP), and cTnI41 are also used to recognize heart function. 
Similarly, B-type natriuretic peptide monitoring identifies patients 
with cyanosis at increased risk of an augmented inflammatory response 
to cardiopulmonary bypass. Insulin-like growth factor-binding 
protein 7 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 which induce 
G1 cell cycle arrest used as biomarkers for AKI and cardiopulmonary 
bypass.42 Growth hormone and its mediator, insulin like growth factor 
1, are key determinants of growth in children and young adults. It can 
also identify other forms of congenital heart disease (Table 2).43
Diagnostic biomarkers
Flow cytometry,44 cardiac magnetic resonance,45 and 
echocardiographic are is used as diagnostic tool for finding defects in 
both the right and the left heart. Echocardiographic is also used to detect 
pediatric PAH that can be correlated both at presentation and during 
the course of the disease.46 Renal near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS is 
a promising non-invasive tool that is used for multimodal monitoring 
of kidney function and developing AKI in infants undergoing cardiac 
surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.46 Apolipoprotein E plays  Emerging biomarkers of congenital heart diseases and disorders113

DOI: 10.15406/jsrt.2016.01.00021critical role in modulating the response to neurological injury after 
cardiopulmonary bypass in children.47 Transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation is becoming a standard treatment for non-operable and 
high-risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis 
(Table 2).48 Electroencephalography or magneto encephalography 
or volumetric measures of certain brain regions by using magnetic 
resonance imaging provide both accuracy and specificity and clarity 
about brain related abnormalities in children and adults.
Therapeutic biomarkers
Therapeutic biomarkers could establish specific interaction of 
drugs to heart diseases or find abnormalities related to biomolecules 
and cells of cardiac system. MicroRNAs (miRs) a small, highly 
conserved, non-coding RNAs can be used as important therapeutic 
biomarkers. Similarly, long-term use of pravastatin, simvastatin, 
atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin, statins, may be effective in the primary 
and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events through an anti-
inflammatory effect, Prostaglandin E1 has been used clinically for 
improving heart diseases. Similarly high-risk patients can be treated 
with lipid-lowering agents to have a normal LDL-C level. Lycopene 
intake reduces the incidence of CVD. Measurement of Lp(a) for 
risk assessment of patients with known CHD. α-linolenic acid 
(ALA), a plant-derived omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid and 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase are important therapeutic 
biomarker. Similarly, atorvastatin improved plasma levels of an 
expanded panel of nonlipid biomarkers.
The pulmonary homograft is used to remove congenital aortic 
stenosis by following. Serum levels of soluble ICAM-1 can provide 
confirmation about pulmonary artery hypertension in children.36 
Similarly, total right/left-volume index should be used as a new 
and simplified CMR measure, allowing more accurate assessment 
of disease severity.44 Echocardiography and Fontan surgery are used to 
assess the systemic right ventricle problems in patients with repaired 
tetralogy of Fallot. There is a need to have many more researches 
on development of new advanced management tools are finding risk 
stratification and understanding the role of novel biomarkers related to 
surgical treatments (Table 2). 
Clinical biomarkers
WBCs, polymorphonuclear cell counts are used as clinical 
biomarkers to detect cardiopulmonary problems. Similarly, plasma 
intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, citrulline, claudin 3, and dual 
sugar permeability, intestinal epithelial integrity, epithelial function, 
paracellular integrity, and paracellular functions, loss of intestinal 
epithelial barrier function are used to display primary congenital heart 
defects. However, by measuring baseline plasma proinflammatory 
(interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ) and 
anti-inflammatory (interleukin-4 and interleukin-10) cytokines, 
cardiopulmonary problems can be identified. Plasma biomarkers are 
used to reflect intestinal epithelial barrier function (cellular and 
paracellular) in cardiopulmonary defects.49 Erythropoietin functional 
activity determination help in assessment of in vitro  pulmonary artery 
endothelial cell networking and smooth muscle cell proliferation 
assays (Table 2). Serum spectrin breakdown products may potentially 
be developed as biomarkers for brain necrosis and apoptosis in infants 
with congenital heart disease. Prenatal diagnosis of neural defects 
can be done in utero by measuring alpha fetoprotein. Ultrasound is 
used to visualize the defects in fetus while amniocentesis is used to 
detect teratogenic defects. Level of serum uric acid and pituitary and thyroid hormone are used to find malformations are also related to 
reproductive failures in adults. 
More functional genetic markers are copy number variations, 
single gene mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms are 
responsible for the development of CHD.28 Aneuploidy, or abnormal 
chromosomal number, is also one of the important reasons of CHD. 
Normally, most of the CHD cases were observed in new born 
associating with some chromosomal abnormality.29 Fifty percent 
of cases born with Trisomy 21 have CHD mainly displaying either 
atrial or ventricular septal defects to atrioventricular canal lesions. 
Similarly, Trisomy 18, bear CHD, more usually in the form of septal 
defects. Approximately one-third of females with Turner syndrome, 
or monosomy X, have CHD. Approximately one-third of females 
with Turner syndrome, or monosomy X, have CHD. In such cases 
chromosomal defects in patients with CHD can be detected by using 
chromosomal G-banded karyotype. Klinefelter syndrome males who 
display 47 chromosomes (XXY), showed fifty percent incidences 
of CHD i.e ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defects.29 However, 
different types of chromosomal abnormalities can be established by 
using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In this technique 
fluorescent labeled probes are hybridized to study metaphase 
chromosomes to detect small submicroscopic chromosomal deletions 
and duplications. FISH technique is used to establish cause of several 
syndromes caused by chromosomal abnormalities and associating 
with CHDs. Microscopic deletion on chromosome can reveal fact 
about occurrence of most common cardiac malformations such as 
interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, and tetralogy of Fallot, and 
routine with genetic testing.30 The cardio-vascular defects due to any 
syndrome can be traced by identifying loss of elastin due to mutations 
that causes supravalvar aortic stenosis.31,32 Similar abnormalities can 
be identified by measuring alpha II-spectrin breakdown products 
in the serum.33 Non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) is emerging as new 
fundamental regulators of gene expression (Table 2). microRNAs and 
lncRNAs work as clinical biomarkers for aortic aneurysm.7
Future developments
For finding better diagnostic and therapeutic care of CHD patients 
technological advancements be needed in the field of functional 
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and bioinformatics to have 
new putative markers to decide various abnormal stages of congenital 
disorders. Thus multimarker profiling of CHD individuals based on 
real variations may focus on more possible treatment and clinical care 
in the future. In addition, epigenetic effects of series of environmental 
carcinogens in human population in industrialized countries resulting 
in prenatal and post natal defects of cardiac structure and function in 
early stage children can be explored. 
Conclusion
For better clinical care of CHD patients and diagnosis there is a 
need of systematic organization of tools, methods, rules, strategies, 
medical diagnostic information with coordinated and concerted 
efforts of clinicians, research groups, technology experts, industry 
and regulatory agencies. Both standardization and technological

Congenital heart diseases are substantially appeared before or after 
birth. There are two important disease categories which are commonly 
appeared in after birth vascular, congenital heart disease. Right 
ventricular hypertrophy is one of important congenital heart disease. 
These abnormalities are related to either structure or function of heart 
and also found associated to cardiovascular system. In principle these 
are recognizable in early life and are observed in 7-12 of every 1000 
live births. But it is of all the trivial lesions which are recognized 
in early child hood. During infancy 50-60 per cent of these patients 
need medical and surgical help, among total non-treated patients only 
10-15 per cent get survive without surgery to adolescence and adult 
life. These are known as natural survivors whose congenital defects or 
disease modify with the time and face post natal changes and remain 
abnormal. Prevalence of these diseases show lower child survival 
index that display basal infant and child mortality under the age of 
5years. Besides, children congenital heart diseases, adult congenital 
heart diseases are reported to increasing alarmingly. Though there 
are hundreds of congenital defects and few of them come in rare 
categories. 
Tetralogy of Fallot1 is, neonatal lupus or congenital heart block a 
significant health problems whose pathogenesis is quite complex.2 
Similarly, end-stage heart failure and abnormalities of bicuspid 
aortic valve are also congenital3 (Table 1). Prominent intrapulmonary 
anastomotic vessels or bronchopulmonary shunt vessels is also 
reported in lungs from infants with fatal congenital diaphragmatic 
hernia Down syndrome is the most common viable chromosomal 
disorder with intellectual impairment and several other developmental 
abnormalities. Forty to fifty percent of newborns with down syndrome 
have some form of congenital heart defects.4 Endocardial fibroelastosis 
is a unique form of fibrosis, which forms a de novo sub-endocardial 
tissue layer encapsulating the myocardium and stunting its growth, is 
typically associated with congenital heart diseases of heterogeneous 
origin, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome.5Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a serious complication of 
adult congenital heart disease associated with systemic-to-pulmonary 
shunts and shows markedly increased morbidity and mortality in 
infants.6 Although early shunt closure restricts development of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension, but patients remain at risk even after 
repair. Hyperuricaemia is associated with traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia and shows higher 
mortality (Table 2). An aneurysm is a local dilatation of a vessel wall 
which is >50% of its original diameter. Aortic aneurysms are among 
the most challenging to treat.7 Similarly, early stage heart failure in 
adults is a severe congenital heart disease remains elusive in diagnosis 
(Table 1). Many ACHD ( Adult Congenital Heart Disease) patients 
seem well-compensated owing to chronic physical and psychological 
adaptations, but these remain abnormal even after post surgery they 
report stable health and good quality of life.8 
Biomarkers are important tools which are used for assessment of 
disorder or disease, its clinical diagnosis, prognosis, recurrence and 
possible therapeutics. These are indicators of a biological state and 
can detect alterations in the constituents of tissues or body fluids 
more promptly and accurately. Before treatment establishment of 
cause of deformity and its types should be established to recognize 
high risk groups among patients. Biomarkers are used to explore 
specific defects, and assist in management of postoperative cardiac 
patients facing congenital heart diseases.9 However, by measuring 
levels of important molecules in patient’s tissue fluids clinicians can 
analyze and interpret results to identify congenital heart disease and 
its possible therapeutics.10 For example to establish left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction a test with LR + and LR- negative is used to 
predict the level of risk. Similarly tests based on urine N-terminal 
pro-BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) (N-BNP) test is also followed by a 
plasma N-BNP test that can facilitate screening for asymptomatic left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction in CHD patients. Mainly estimations 
of bio-molecules in body fluids are used for predicting the prognosis 
of patients with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and dilated

Present review aims to discuss new emerging biomarkers that could facilitate authentic 
and fast diagnosis of congenital heart diseases. The population of congenital heart 
disease patients is increasing regularly and serious complications in adults are also 
enormously exceeding in comparison to children. Most of these congenital defects are 
un-curable and becoming challenging to treat. However, for predicting the prognosis 
of patient’s different types of biomarkers i.e. hemodynamic, physiological, genetic, 
molecular, immunological, clinical and therapeutic biomarkers are explained. For 
sequential assessment of major structural and functional defects in CHD (congenital 
heart diseases) patients various bioassays and scientific methods are used to integrate 
defects with symptoms to find therapeutic decisions, targets and goals. This article 
tries to explore therapeutic options and solutions of CHD on the basis of emerging 
biomarkers and assess the need to advent new potential authentic biomarkers.

Hemodynamic or cardiac biomarkers or blood bio -
markers
Most congenital heart diseases have specific hemodynamics, 
including volume and pressure overload. However, by using cardiac 
biomarkers cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, associated 
with anatomical abnormalities can be established. Hemodynamic 
abnormalities can cause activation of neuro hormones, inflammatory 
cytokines, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells, which in turn contribute to the development of pathological conditions such 
as cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac cell damages and 
death. Cardiac biomarkers facilitate the prediction of pathological 
changes that could provide information about the stress placed on 
the myocardial cells, the severity of the damage, the responses of 
neuro humoral factors, and the remodeling of the ventricle (Table 
2). Moreover, assessment of cardiac biomarkers at an earlier stage 
can reduce the myocardial damage and severity of heart failure.11 
Therefore, children with CHD need most appropriate and delicate 
care12 (Table 2).

Physiological markers
Measurement of HDL-C(High-density lipoprotein cholesterol), 
Interleukin (IL-6, 10), 6-hydroxymelatonin, galectin-3 and plasma 
B-type natriuretic peptide low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, 
ischaemic stress and reactive oxygen species, folic acid, vitamin 
B12 are potential physiological biomarkers which can predict the 
risk of congenital heart diseases.12 These are also based on levels of 
homocysteine , hydrogen sulfide, and C-reactive protein in serum 
samples of children, In addition, atrio-ventricular and cardiac muscle 
contraction, ionic interaction and troponin activity are also important 
physiological markers. Similarly, risk prediction algorithms and 
vascular risk prediction rules and statistical scores can assess the 
risk of death or stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and early 
age atherosclerosis. Further, oxygen transport between patients with 
restrictive right ventricle and those without right ventricle decides 
CHD in children13 Serum kinetics in children is also used to identify 
atrial and ventricular septal defects closure in terms of extracorporeal 
circulation. C-reactive protein demonstrates functional status of 
cardiac muscle functional status. Its level can predict clinical outcome 
and mortality in adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated 
with congenital heart disease. Single CRP assessment is also used 
to diagnose antibiotics abuse14 and find out significant differences 
between cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart disease patients 
(Table 2). Children with CHD have shown elevated levels of 
inflammatory cytokines, caspase 3, troponin T, and CKMB which also 
display cardiac health or abnormality. However, by measuring tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vasoendothelial growth 
factor, troponin T, creatin kinase MB, and Caspase 3 levels congenital 
defects can be established in children.15 In addition troponin I; matrix 
metalloproteinase-2; urokinase plasminogen activator; urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; plasminogen; and vitamin D in body 
fluids can establish CHD related inflammation, fibrosis and cardiac 
dysfunction.16
For routine coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment serum 
biomarker specifically associated and based on baseline level of 
triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), body mass index, 
albumin, geriatric nutritional risk index, normalized protein catabolic 
rate, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are 
used. Following CRP and NT-proBNP levels after birth can potentially 
monitor severity and progression of cardiac neonatal lupus.16 Similarly, 
plasma C-terminal fibrinogen growth factor 23, fasting glucose and 
insulin level with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein recognize birth 
related vascular defects in children (Table 2).17 Baseline hemoglobin 
A1c level can accurately predict heart failures due to baseline cardiac 
structural and functional abnormalities. Right heart dysfunction, 
endothelial inflammation and proliferation can be diagnosed by 
measuring plasma levels. Similarly, plasma BNP measurements can 
differentiate congenital heart disease and lung disease and can be used 
to monitor the effects of treatment for infants with heart failure.18
Serum--myocardial fraction of creatine kinase and galectin-3 is 
used as biochemical marker for finding myocardial injury. However, 
increased serum concentration can help to find out clinical and 
paraclinical requirement of CHD children.19 Similarly, Cystatin C 
and serum creatinine level is used to establish acute kidney injury 
in children with congenital heart disease.2 Cystatin C is a better 
glomerular filtration rate marker than serum creatinine.20 Moreover, 
association of cardiac biomarkers  (N-type pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide, creatine kinase-MB , heart-type fatty acid binding protein, 
and troponins I and T can also diagnose postoperative AKI.21 Emerging biomarkers of congenital heart diseases and disorders112

DOI: 10.15406/jsrt.2016.01.00021However, level of certain mediators of neuro hormonal activation 
such as B-type natriuretic peptide and its N-terminal-pro-fragment, and 
vascular endothelial growth factor are used for diagnosing pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with congenital heart disease. 
Acute phase proteins, haptoglobin, SAP, and orosomucoid 2 change 
display Ventricular septal defect patients show intra-cardiac left-to-
right shunt and increased pulmonary flow that may affect the acute 
phase response.22 High-sensitive troponin-T is used for diagnosing 
acute coronary syndrome, in congenital heart disease patients and 
to display myocardial damage related to NT-proBNP and ventricular 
function, its potential predictive value in ACHD patients is promising.23 
Similarly, lower levels of plasma NGAL differentiate patients with 
complex congenital heart disease and cyanotic congenital heart 
disease. Similarly, combined prognostic value of plasma NGAL 
with plasma NT-proBNP in adult patients can predict congenital 
heart disease24 and cardiovascular deaths.25 Differential metabolic 
components (blood pressures) and metabolic pathway network can be 
used as potential biomarkers for hypertension.26 Surfactant protein B 
plasma levels may help to diagnose patients with cardiac problems 
diminishing the alveolocapillary membrane stability (Table 2). More 
specifically, plasma levels can be measured in the preoperative and 
postoperative periods.24
Genetic markers
Genetic biomarkers are DNA sequences in gene which are 
responsible for disease or associated with susceptibility to disease. 
SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) demonstrate significant 
variations among genes and are used to find risk stratification for 
ventricular arrhythmias in survivors of acute coronary syndromes and 
arrhythmic events after ACS (antireticular cytotoxic serum).27 Similarly, 
differential expression of HUB genes i.e. UBC, APP, HUWE1 and 
SRC display both congenital disorders and congenital heart defects 
in newborns (CHD) and are established genetic markers.4 Similarly, 
sequencing of important neonatal genes and its expression in tissues 
can help in identification of cardiac disorders (both syndromic and 
nonsyndromic disorders).28 Similarly, abnormal karyotype can work 
as good marker for establishing fetal congenital heart disease during 
pregnancy. More functional genetic markers are copy number 
variations, single gene mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms 
are responsible for the development of CHD.28 Aneuploidy, or 
abnormal chromosomal number, is also one of the important reasons 
of CHD. Normally, most of the CHD cases were observed in new 
born associating with some chromosomal abnormality.29 Fifty percent 
of cases born with Trisomy 21 have CHD mainly displaying either 
atrial or ventricular septal defects to atrioventricular canal lesions. 
Similarly, Trisomy 18, bear CHD, more usually in the form of septal 
defects. Approximately one-third of females with Turner syndrome, 
or monosomy X, have CHD. Approximately one-third of females 
with Turner syndrome, or monosomy X, have CHD. In such cases 
chromosomal defects in patients with CHD can be detected by using 
chromosomal G-banded karyotype. Klinefelter syndrome males who 
display 47 chromosomes (XXY), showed fifty percent incidences 
of CHD i.e ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defects.29 However, 
different types of chromosomal abnormalities can be established by 
using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In this technique 
fluorescent labeled probes are hybridized to study metaphase 
chromosomes to detect small submicroscopic chromosomal deletions 
and duplications. FISH technique is used to establish cause of several 
syndromes caused by chromosomal abnormalities and associating with CHDs. Microscopic deletion on chromosome can reveal fact 
about occurrence of most common cardiac malformations such as 
interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, and tetralogy of Fallot, and 
routine with genetic testing.30 The cardio-vascular defects due to any 
syndrome can be traced by identifying loss of elastin due to mutations 
that causes supravalvar aortic stenosis.31,32 Similar abnormalities can 
be identified by measuring alpha II-spectrin breakdown products 
in the serum.33 Non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) is emerging as new 
fundamental regulators of gene expression (Table 2). microRNAs and 
lncRNAs work as clinical biomarkers for aortic aneurysm.7
Immunological biomarkers
Interleukin-6, 174 GC polymorphism and C-reactive protein 
can recognize idiopathic cardiac arrhythmias in children.34 
Similarly, ratio between specific anti-52 Ro/SSA-p200 antibodies 
displays congenital heart block.35 It is used to identify mothers at higher 
risk to deliver affected children. ICAM-1 is a potential biomarker 
to be used for the diagnosis and follow-up of pulmonary artery 
hypertension (Table 2).36 Other important immunological biomarkers 
which could provide better specificity about CHD are levels of 
different cytokines, chemokines, circulating antigens, antibodies in 
serum and constitutively expressed natural auto antibodies (na-Ab) 
which interact specifically with different self-antigens and plurality of 
anti-self receptors of auto reactive T-lymphocytes.
Molecular markers
Molecular biomarkers based on presence of circulating miRNA 
expression profilesare used to predict congenital heart diseases 
mainly for clinical diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
associated abnormalities.37 Congenital heart disease patients show 
high levels of natriuretic peptide (NP) in comparison to normal 
controls. Similarly, levels of norepinephrine found altered in 
symptomatic patients, especially those with unrepaired congenital 
heart disease, Eisenmenger syndrome, pulmonary hypertension and 
adult congenital heart failure.38 These are used as, molecular markers 
for prediction of congenital heart disease.39 Similarly, level ofTBX5 
a transcription factor diagnose embryonic cardiac defects.40 Its 2.77 
and 3.51 times higher levels of miR-10a and miR-10b expression in 
the heart tissues display congenital heart diseases. Similarly, levels of 
-fatty acid-binding protein, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP), and cTnI41 are also used to recognize heart function. 
Similarly, B-type natriuretic peptide monitoring identifies patients 
with cyanosis at increased risk of an augmented inflammatory response 
to cardiopulmonary bypass. Insulin-like growth factor-binding 
protein 7 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 which induce 
G1 cell cycle arrest used as biomarkers for AKI and cardiopulmonary 
bypass.42 Growth hormone and its mediator, insulin like growth factor 
1, are key determinants of growth in children and young adults. It can 
also identify other forms of congenital heart disease (Table 2).43
Diagnostic biomarkers
Flow cytometry,44 cardiac magnetic resonance,45 and 
echocardiographic are is used as diagnostic tool for finding defects in 
both the right and the left heart. Echocardiographic is also used to detect 
pediatric PAH that can be correlated both at presentation and during 
the course of the disease.46 Renal near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS is 
a promising non-invasive tool that is used for multimodal monitoring 
of kidney function and developing AKI in infants undergoing cardiac 
surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.46 Apolipoprotein E plays  Emerging biomarkers of congenital heart diseases and disorders113

DOI: 10.15406/jsrt.2016.01.00021critical role in modulating the response to neurological injury after 
cardiopulmonary bypass in children.47 Transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation is becoming a standard treatment for non-operable and 
high-risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis 
(Table 2).48 Electroencephalography or magneto encephalography 
or volumetric measures of certain brain regions by using magnetic 
resonance imaging provide both accuracy and specificity and clarity 
about brain related abnormalities in children and adults.
Therapeutic biomarkers
Therapeutic biomarkers could establish specific interaction of 
drugs to heart diseases or find abnormalities related to biomolecules 
and cells of cardiac system. MicroRNAs (miRs) a small, highly 
conserved, non-coding RNAs can be used as important therapeutic 
biomarkers. Similarly, long-term use of pravastatin, simvastatin, 
atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin, statins, may be effective in the primary 
and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events through an anti-
inflammatory effect, Prostaglandin E1 has been used clinically for 
improving heart diseases. Similarly high-risk patients can be treated 
with lipid-lowering agents to have a normal LDL-C level. Lycopene 
intake reduces the incidence of CVD. Measurement of Lp(a) for 
risk assessment of patients with known CHD. α-linolenic acid 
(ALA), a plant-derived omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid and 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase are important therapeutic 
biomarker. Similarly, atorvastatin improved plasma levels of an 
expanded panel of nonlipid biomarkers.
The pulmonary homograft is used to remove congenital aortic 
stenosis by following. Serum levels of soluble ICAM-1 can provide 
confirmation about pulmonary artery hypertension in children.36 
Similarly, total right/left-volume index should be used as a new 
and simplified CMR measure, allowing more accurate assessment 
of disease severity.44 Echocardiography and Fontan surgery are used to 
assess the systemic right ventricle problems in patients with repaired 
tetralogy of Fallot. There is a need to have many more researches 
on development of new advanced management tools are finding risk 
stratification and understanding the role of novel biomarkers related to 
surgical treatments (Table 2). 
Clinical biomarkers
WBCs, polymorphonuclear cell counts are used as clinical 
biomarkers to detect cardiopulmonary problems. Similarly, plasma 
intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, citrulline, claudin 3, and dual 
sugar permeability, intestinal epithelial integrity, epithelial function, 
paracellular integrity, and paracellular functions, loss of intestinal 
epithelial barrier function are used to display primary congenital heart 
defects. However, by measuring baseline plasma proinflammatory 
(interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ) and 
anti-inflammatory (interleukin-4 and interleukin-10) cytokines, 
cardiopulmonary problems can be identified. Plasma biomarkers are 
used to reflect intestinal epithelial barrier function (cellular and 
paracellular) in cardiopulmonary defects.49 Erythropoietin functional 
activity determination help in assessment of in vitro  pulmonary artery 
endothelial cell networking and smooth muscle cell proliferation 
assays (Table 2). Serum spectrin breakdown products may potentially 
be developed as biomarkers for brain necrosis and apoptosis in infants 
with congenital heart disease. Prenatal diagnosis of neural defects 
can be done in utero by measuring alpha fetoprotein. Ultrasound is 
used to visualize the defects in fetus while amniocentesis is used to 
detect teratogenic defects. Level of serum uric acid and pituitary and thyroid hormone are used to find malformations are also related to 
reproductive failures in adults. 
More functional genetic markers are copy number variations, 
single gene mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms are 
responsible for the development of CHD.28 Aneuploidy, or abnormal 
chromosomal number, is also one of the important reasons of CHD. 
Normally, most of the CHD cases were observed in new born 
associating with some chromosomal abnormality.29 Fifty percent 
of cases born with Trisomy 21 have CHD mainly displaying either 
atrial or ventricular septal defects to atrioventricular canal lesions.

defects. Approximately one-third of females with Turner syndrome,

that causes supravalvar aortic stenosis.31,32 Similar abnormalities can 
be identified by measuring alpha II-spectrin breakdown products 
in the serum.33 Non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) is emerging as new 
fundamental regulators of gene expression (Table 2). microRNAs and 
lncRNAs work as clinical biomarkers for aortic aneurysm.7
Future developments
For finding better diagnostic and therapeutic care of CHD patients 
technological advancements be needed in the field of functional 
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and bioinformatics to have 
new putative markers to decide various abnormal stages of congenital 
disorders. Thus multimarker profiling of CHD individuals based on 
real variations may focus on more possible treatment and clinical care 
in the future. In addition, epigenetic effects of series of environmental 
carcinogens in human population in industrialized countries resulting 
in prenatal and post natal defects of cardiac structure and function in 
early stage children can be explored. 
Conclusion
For better clinical care of CHD patients and diagnosis there is a 
need of systematic organization of tools, methods, rules, strategies, 
medical diagnostic information with coordinated and concerted 
efforts of clinicians, research groups, technology experts, industry 
and regulatory agencies. Both standardization and technological 
advancement of existing diagnostic and therapeutic methods is 
needed for reduction of congenital heart disease risks related to 
heart failure In addition, risk prediction algorithms should develop, 
and standardize to incorporate select biomarkers that could enable 
clinicians to predict the absolute event rates of CHD. As emerging 
risks are found to be affiliated with minor and micro-level factors and  Emerging biomarkers of congenital heart diseases and disorders114

to find mixed CHDs. Hence, there is an urgent need of exploration 
of new emerging biomarkers that could facilitate more authentic and 
fast diagnosis of congenital heart failures and various structural and

Abstract: Dilatation of the aorta is a constantly evolving condition that can lead to the ultimate
life-threatening event, acute aortic dissection. Recent research has tried to identify quantiﬁable
biomarkers, with both diagnostic and prognostic roles in different aortopathies. Most studies have
focused on the bicuspid aortic valve, the most frequent congenital heart disease (CHD), and majorly
evolved around matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Other candidate biomarkers, such as asymmetric
dimethylarginine, soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products or transforming growth fac-
tor beta have also gained a lot of attention recently. Most of the aortic anomalies and dilatation-related
studies have reported expression variation of tissular biomarkers. The ultimate goal remains, though,
the identiﬁcation of biomarkers among the serum plasma, with the upregulation of circulating MMP-
1, MMP-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine
(ADMA), soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) and transforming growth
factor beta (TGF- ) being reported in association to several aortopathies and related complications
in recent research. These molecules are apparently quantiﬁable from the early ages and have been
linked to several CHDs and hereditary aortopathies. Pediatric data on the matter is still limited, and
further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of plasmatic biomarkers in the long term follow-up
of potentially evolving congenital aortopathies.

1. Introduction
Aortopathies or the dilatation of the aorta involving the root or descending aorta have
gained a lot of interest recently due to the signiﬁcant progress in imaging techniques, which
has led to a greater understanding of their pathophysiological underlying mechanisms [ 1,2].
Traditionally, these conditions are most frequently associated with congenital heart disease
(CHD) but also comprise of hereditary aortopathies encountered among genetic syndromes
such as Marfan, Turner or Ehlers-Danlos [2]. Thus, their classiﬁcation is based upon three
main etiological subtypes, namely [3–8]:
 Syndromic—associated with genetic syndromes (Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, Ehler-Danlos
type IV and Turner) and presenting an increased risk of dissection;
 Primary—associated with CHD, including aortic coarctation, conotruncal abnormal-
ities (persistent truncus arterious, great vessels transposition, double outlet right
ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle), left heart hypoplastic
syndrome or bicuspid aortic valve (BAV);
 Secondary—a consequence of surgical intervention (arterial switch, ROSS or
Fontan procedure).

In adults, the dilatation of the aorta is deﬁned as dilation that exceeds 1.1–1.5 times
the normal caliber, whereas an aneurysmal dilation is even greater than 1.5 times, with
normal reference values established through wide-based population studies [ 9]. However,
in children, the assessment of aortic dilatation is based upon the z score, with an upper
limit of 2.1 being taken into account as an absolute increase in aortic diameter. This z score
is based upon sex, height, weight, age and body weight surface and is considered a more
reliable indicator over time that is able to assess dissection risk [ 10]. These measurements
of the aorta can be easily performed with the help of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).
Regular 2D ultrasound imaging of the aorta is mandatory, not only for diagnosis but also for
follow-up, in order to assess the evolution of the aortic caliber and to establish the timing
of prophylactical surgical intervention for preventing the ultimate life-threatening event,
aortic dissection. Its main limitation is the underestimation of the largest caliber of the vessel
lying in the lateral plane in subjects with asymmetrical aortic dilatation [ 10]. Therefore, a
more precise assessment requires multimodal imaging [ 11]. This includes 3D ultrasound,
as well as transesophageal echocardiography (TOE), which allows the visualization of the
aortic valve, root and ascending and descending aorta. Furthermore, 3D TOE is apparently
able to better evaluate entry tear size, but its additional utility over 2D TOE has yet to be
established [ 12,13]. TOE allows measurements similar to those provided by computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is especially preferred in those
subjects in which the administration of contrast substance is put into question (due to
a history of allergies or renal function impairment), but this is highly dependent upon
the examinator’s experience [ 11]. In particular, CT, consisting of non-enhanced scanning,
followed by a contrast-enhanced angiography, presents the advantage of quick image
acquisition and 3D reconstruction, but ionizing radiation exposure associated with its
use limits its application as a follow-up instrument, especially in children [ 14]. The main
drawback of the aforementioned imaging tools remains their uneven availability and their
dependence upon their performance techniques [15–17].
The physiopathological mechanism description of aortopathies is strongly based upon
the embryological development of the cardiac structure and the adaptative structural
modiﬁcation of the aortic wall, which are initiated during fetal life and continue in the
ﬁrst postnatal weeks. The main histological components of the great vessel wall, elastin,
collagen and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), undergo signiﬁcant changes due to local hemo-
dynamic alterations. For example, the last pre-natal week sees a rapid accumulation of
collagen and elastin in the wall of the ascending aorta, particularly involving its thoracic
component [ 17]. Still, data in the literature supports the theory that blood ﬂow or pressure
variation determines continuous alterations in smooth muscle and collagen contents. This
process will continue after neonatal life, whereas elastin expression will lower signiﬁcantly
after birth, and thus elastin content will remain stable through most of life [18,19].
A better understanding of the pathogenesis and of the continuous evolvement of
aortic dilatation has created the premises for several studies that have tried to identify
biomarkers with the ability to predict changes in the structure of the aortic wall and to
distinguish etiological subtypes [ 20–22]. Most of them have evolved around the role of
proteolytic enzymes, which determine a reduction in the extracellular matrix, thus leading
to an abnormal remodeling of the aortic wall media. Special attention has been given to
metalloproteinases, as well as to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase and the impact of
their disbalanced secretion [ 20]. Other examples include asymmetric dimethylarginine
(ADMA), the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) and transform-
ing growth factor- 1 (TGF- 1) [23–25]. Protein units such as hemoglobin subunits alpha,
beta and delta have been positively correlated with the maximal ascending aortic diameter,
whereas mannan-binding lectin serine protease has been negatively correlated with the
same parameter [ 21]. The ultimate goal of recent research is to investigate the utility of
biomarkers, which can be quantiﬁed in serum plasma, but studies are still undergoing,
and most of the research has so far focused on the bicuspid aortic valve due to its high
frequency among the general population [26–30]. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 4993 3 of 17
This review aims to highlight the diagnostic and prognostic role of the most intensely
studied serum plasma biomarkers in different aortopathies, in light of recent literature data.
A special focus will be given to pediatric aortic dilatation, which is an evolving condition
that requires close and continuous follow-up.
1.1. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs)
MMPs are a family of proteolytic enzymes that cleave different components of the
extracellular matrix. Their activity is highly dependent upon the extracellular matrix
components, and their expression is rather low in healthy tissues. The homeostasis of the
vascular wall is insured by the balance between MMP , plasminogen activator–plasmin sys-
tem activity and the concentration of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [ 31,32].
MMP expression is regulated by several growth factors and cytokines that upregulate
or downregulate the transcription of their genes [ 33]. The in vivo function of MMPs still
requires elucidation, as most of these are secreted as inactive zymogens and can only be
detected by zymography, but enzymatic activity has been linked to their gene expres-
sion [ 34,35]. Therefore, the discovery of their activators, such as membrane-type matrix
metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs), represented an important step towards understanding
MMP role, as they are bound to the cell surface and regulate cellular function [34].
Evidence has emerged regarding the central role of MMPs in vascular remodeling,
with studies supporting an association between their increased expression and atheroscle-
rosis progression through the migration stimulation of smooth muscle cells towards the
intima of the vascular wall [ 36,37]. An emphasis on these two previously mentioned met-
alloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in recent studies can be attributed to their critical,
proven roles in aneurysm development. MMP-2 is found in mesenchymal cells and seems
to be linked to macrophage invasion, being the highest abundant elastase in abdominal
aortic aneurysm tissue [ 38]. MT-MMP-1 represents a major activator of pro-MMP-2; the
inactive precursor of MMP-2 and its inhibition in the context of shear wall stress has
been associated with reduced MMP-2 secretion and the invasion of smooth muscle cells
through the extracellular matrix [ 39,40]. MMP-9 degrades extracellular components of
the aortic wall, being expressed by smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes and macrophages.
Its activation seems to be triggered by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which can be produced
by vascular SMCs and mediates inﬂammation processes. Both MMP9 and TLR4 seem to
be overexpressed in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms and seem to be together
involved in the pathogenesis of aortic remodeling [ 41]. In a similar fashion to MMP-2, an
increase in MMP-9 levels and balance change MMP-9/TIMP-1 has been associated with
valve remodeling [42]. This process is also intensely linked to ECM component alteration,
in a similar fashion to the pathophysiological basis of atherosclerosis, especially in relation
to the development of aortic stenosis and, to a lesser extent, to the one of aortic regurgita-
tion [ 43]. Moreover, experimental studies conducted on mice showed that both MMP-2 and
MMP-9 act complementarily in aortic aneurysm development [ 44]. MMP-2 still remains,
though, the easiest to identify among mesenchymal cells, MMP-9 along with other MMPs
such as MMP-3 and MMP-7 being synthetized by inﬂammatory cells [45].
Most of the literature data so far is based upon histology, and more precisely upon the
immunohistochemical assessment of various MMPs within the aortic wall. A signiﬁcant
increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 was noted by Koullias et al. in the bicuspid aortic valve
in a study that enrolled patients with aortic stenosis with/without an associated aortic
aneurysm/dissection [ 42]. In the same study, in the study subgroup of patients with an
aortic aneurysm/dissection (seven patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and six patients
with a tricuspid aortic valve), only a signiﬁcant augmentation of MMP-9 expression was
noted. Furthermore, TIMP-1 expression was higher in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve
and aortic stenosis as opposed to their tricuspid valve homologues [ 42]. The best situs
for determining the expression of each of the three aforementioned metalloproteinases
(MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9) seems to be the intima, where their overexpression can
be noted at the entry dissection site of the ascending aorta, according to Ishii et al. [ 46]. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 4993 4 of 17
Immunohistochemical studies have also highlighted differences in MMP expression within
the abdominal aorta. MMP-9 seems to be produced to a higher extent in abdominal than
in thoracic aortic aneurysms [ 47]. Furthermore, the expression of the mRNA transcript of
MMP-9 might also be inﬂuenced by aortic diameters. In particular, a study that analyzed
infrarenal aortic specimens proved that MMP-9 mRNA expression is higher in moderate
diameter abdominal aortic aneurysms (5–6.9 cm) than in small ones, as they present better
chances of further expansion [48].
The imminent, progressive evolution of aortic dilatation towards dissection calls
though for the discovery and validation of circulating biomarkers, with an anticipatory
role of catastrophic adverse events. MMP-1, TIMP-1 and MMP-2 were documented as
reliable plasmatic biomarkers for the prediction of aortic surgery, positively associated
with peak systolic wall shear stress (WSS) and time-average WSS (TAWSS). An increase
in their circulating levels, in combination with non-invasively obtained wall shear stress
parameters (with the help of 4D ﬂow MRI and computed tomography angiography),
seems to be highly sensitive and a speciﬁc marker of future ascending aortic aneurysm
surgery [ 40]. Another study conﬁrmed the upregulation of MMP-1 and MMP-2 in aortic
dissection through a comparison with healthy controls, as well as the important role of
miRNA-320 in their post-transcriptional regulation, after the lipopolysaccharide-induced
activation of macrophages [ 49]. Nevertheless, MMP-9 has been documented as a reliable
plasmatic marker of the ﬁnal stages of aneurysm development processes in subjects with
chronic thoracic aortic disease [50].
Given the high frequency of BAV among the general population, with an incidence
reported as high as 2% [ 51], it is unsurprising that most of the research gravitating around
the subject of MMPs has focused on the role of these biomarkers in the pathogenesis of
complications related to this particular cardiac malformation. In BAV , a key element of
aortic aneurysm pathogenesis is the imbalance between the proteolytic effect of MMP-2 and
TIMP1. A comparative study conducted on subjects with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta,
divided into two groups based upon the morphology of the aortic valve, proved that this
particular disbalance is only associated with BAV , and not with the tricuspid aortic valve
(TAV) [ 35]. Furthermore, in young men with BAV and the dilation of the proximal aorta,
an increase in plasmatic levels of MMP-2 has been found, in association with systemic
endothelial dysfunction [ 22]. This elevation in circulating MMP-2 level in association
with aortic dilation in patients diagnosed with BAV , without any other echocardiographic
abnormalities, has also been conﬁrmed by another study, which reported simultaneously
an increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 circulating levels only in those patients with severe,
isolated aortic stenosis [27].
Although most of the published research has focused on the role of MMP-1, MMP-2
and MMP-9 in the development of aortic pathologies, a few isolated studies have also
addressed other MMPs as well. MMP-14 and MMP-19 showed higher mRNA expression in
the media of dilated thoracic aortas of patients with TAV , with MMP-19 also being positively
associated to maximal aortic diameters [ 52]. Ikonomidis et al. evaluated the implications of
multiple MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12, MMP-13,
MMP-14 and MMP-15) and brought into light the paradoxical decrease in MMP-3 and
MMP-14 in association with the medium-sized aneurysm group and BAV as opposed to
the small or large aneurysm group. Contrarily, the authors reported a signiﬁcant increase
in MMP-7 levels in patients diagnosed with large aneurysms and TAV and an increase
in MMP-13 values in patients diagnosed with medium-sized aneurysms and TAV [ 35].
Therefore, miscellaneous results and discrepancies between aneurysm size and aortic valve
morphology underline the need for future studies that need to analyze the simultaneous
implications of multiple MMPs in the pathogenesis of vicious aortic remodeling.
New insights into genetic polymorphisms of MMPs have been recently provided.
Genetic polymorphisms of several MMPs, such as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8 and
MMP-12, have been associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events [ 53].
An increased risk of thoracic aortic disease was found in relation to genotype peculiarities Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 4993 5 of 17
of MMP-1 and MMP-9 in a study conducted in Poland [ 54]. Furthermore, a link between
genetic polymorphisms of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and the unfavorable evolution of abdominal
aortic aneurysm repair has been documented through a positive association with endoleaks
incidence [ 55]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMP-9 have also been pos-
itively associated with both slow-growing and aggressively evolving abdominal aortic
aneurysms [ 56]. Moreover, genotype particularities of MMP-2 have also been associated
with aortic diameter increase and aortic dissection [ 57]. TIMP polymorphisms have also
been shown to play an important role in the development of BAV aortopathy, with one
study particularly showing that deleterious variants of TIMP-3 and hemizygous genotype
of TIMP-1 pose an increased risk of developing this condition in patients with Turner
syndrome [58].
Most research studies have so far enrolled adult and elderly patients, due to the evolv-
ing aortic dilatation in time and its related complications. MMP levels have been known
to be positively associated with age increase and hypertension [ 50]. Still, the question of
the utility of early MMP circulating values depiction has been raised, and thus pediatric
studies on the subject have started to appear. Similarly to adult populations, a correlation
between increased MMP-2 values and arterial stiffness has been reported in a pediatric
population with chronic kidney disease and concomitant arterial hypertension [ 59]. Most
pediatric studies have mainly focused, though, on patients with congenital heart defects.
In children, a signiﬁcant increase in serum plasma MMP-2 levels has been reported in
association with Marfan syndrome, according to Cui et al. Contrariwise, MMP-9 presented
insigniﬁcant variations compared to healthy controls within the same study [ 60]. Further-
more, another study accentuated the active implications of MMPs in connective tissue
remodeling, proving an association between a signiﬁcant increase in MMP-9 levels and the
spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defects (VSDs) [ 61]. The authors also discussed
the dependence of normal tissular and extracellular matrix (ECM) development upon MMP
activity, as well as the insufﬁcient data regarding the dynamic of MMP levels through
the human heart and big vessel development [ 61]. Still, in subjects with congenital BAV
malformations, the increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels has been attributed to ﬁbbrilin-1
deﬁciency among the vasculature, which seems to be independent of age progression and
valvular function [62].
MMPs still remain the most researched entities in aortic-related pathologies and have
so far shown the highest potential in evolving towards circulating biomarkers of this
condition, based on recent literature data. A summary of the previously described studied
and the association between tissular and circulating MMP expression variation, aortic
anomalies and their complications has been provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

1.2. Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA)
ADMA represents an inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthetase, nitric oxide being respon-
sible for active vascular remodeling. Nitric oxide (NO) regulates the endothelial secretion of
pro-MMP-2, and elevated ADMA levels (which determine NO deﬁciency) will in turn lead
to increased MMP-2 production [ 63,64]. Given the endothelial disfunction associated with
BAV , some studies have successfully identiﬁed an association between elevated ADMA
and MMP-2 and, consequently, the proximal dilatation of the ascending aorta in patients
with non-stenotic BAV [ 28]. BAV morphology does not, on the other hand, necessarily
inﬂuence ADMA levels, high ADMA values being associated with an ascending aortic
diameter, without signiﬁcant differences from patients with TAV [ 23]. The same lack of
correlation with valve morphology, but with endothelial disfunction and inﬂammation
mediator release, has been conﬁrmed by Ali et al. [65].
A case-control study concluded that serum ADMA can be used as a reliable, highly
sensitive and speciﬁc marker of ascending aortic dilatation [ 66]. Tzemos et al. further
conﬁrmed these ﬁndings, highlighting a positive association between the dilation of the
proximal aorta and increase in serum ADMA and MMP-2 in a young male population
diagnosed with BAV , as a result of systemic endothelial dysfunction [ 22]. Considering
the increase in ADMA levels as a result of endothelial disfunction, literature data have
proposed this biomarker as a tool that can assess cardiovascular risk [ 67]. This hypothesis
started from oxidative stress, an essential element of the atherosclerotic process, increase in
nitric oxide, leading to the stimulation of ADMA production, which will further inhibit the
action of the nitric oxide synthetase [ 68]. Thus, ADMA has been regarded as a risk factor
of acute coronary events, capable of inducing myocardial hypertrophy as well as ﬁbrosis
through the activation of ﬁbroblast growth factors receptors [69,70].
In children, ADMA levels are physiologically higher, their decrease being associated
with a lack of a protection against oxidative stress in conditions such as type I diabetes
mellitus [ 71]. Their prognostic utility and potential use as a therapeutic target in pediatric
chronic kidney disease has been described in a recent review article [ 72], but data regarding
the biomarker role of ADMA in predicting the cardiovascular risk of this in patients is
scarce. Furthermore, there are no pediatric studies in the literature on the subject of serum
ADMA in aortic dilatation. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 4993 9 of 17

1.3. Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products (sRAGE)
The represents a receptor for advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are able
to induce oxidative stress and trigger inﬂammation processes [ 73,74]. Furthermore, through
ligand-binding competition for RAGE, sRAGEs attenuate the activation of the nuclear-factor
kappa-B (NF- B) pathway and thus also stimulate chronic inﬂammation and oxidative
stress [ 75,76]. Therefore, sRAGEs have been investigated for their potential biomarker role
in various vascular disorders, including atherosclerosis and aortopathies [24,76].
The need for exploration of the potential circulating biomarker role of sRAGEs in
the prediction of presence and prognosis of aortic aneurysms had ﬁrst been proposed
bySarkar et al. , who described in a review article the role of the sRAGE pathway in
the development of aortic disease [ 73]. This theory was sustained by previously pub- Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 4993 10 of 17
lished experimental studies conducted in mice, which suggested that sRAGE levels in-
crease in the presence of thoracic aortic aneurysms and that the negative modulation
of RAGE is a potential therapeutic solution towards inhibiting the formation and pro-
gression of aneurysms [50,77,78]. The AGE-sRAGE axis has been hypothesized to be in-
volved in thoracic aortic aneurysm pathogenesis, with a signiﬁcant correlation between the
AGE/endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE) ratio and IL-2 and IL-6 release [79].
Elevated sRAGE values have been also correlated with the sole presence of BAV ,
not necessarily in relation to the aortic diameter [ 24]. On the other hand, the periodic
monitorization of this biomarker might be useful in evaluating the progression of bicuspid
aortic aneurysms through the NF-kB pathway [80].
In children, studies investigating the role of sRAGE in aortopathies and aortic wall
impairment are missing. A pediatric study has shown that childhood sRAGE levels are
physiologically higher than in adults and that, consequently, their biomarker potential in
the diagnosis of mild pulmonary arterial hypertension might only be considered in adult
populations [ 81]. Thus, their role in various pathologies cannot yet be established and
requires further analysis.

TGF- includes a family of cytokines that regulates cell growth, differentiation and
inﬂammation and is involved in vascular remodeling through ECM composition regula-
tion [ 82,83]. Biological effects of TGF- release might be dependent upon serum concentra-
tion, but its role in maintaining vascular wall integrity can no longer be contested [ 84,85].
Low levels of TGF- stimulate smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell proliferation, while
high levels inhibit the aforementioned physiological processes [86].
The involvement of TGF- in ECM modeling is still controversial. Evidence has
shown that TGF- enhances collagen production, leads to ﬁbrosis, and inhibits matrix
degradation [ 87,88]. Moreover, TGF- seems to play an important part in maintaining
the equilibrium of the ECM content. The augmentation of TGF- expression seems to
be able to stabilize ECM remodeling by decreasing inﬂammatory inﬁltrates among the
arterial wall and MMP [ 89]. On the other hand, TGF- signaling pathway activation
stimulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 production, which both determine matrix degradation, a
key milestone in aortic aneurysm formation [ 90]. The activation of this pathway has been
one thoroughly discussed in Marfan syndrome and is also responsible for the augmented
expression of the SMAD-dependent proﬁbrotic signaling pathway, which will lead to ECM
remodeling through the promotion of collagen, elastin, ﬁbrillin or ﬁbronectin synthesis [ 91].
Thus, multiple studies have tried to determine the biomarker role of TGF- in relation to
aortic aneurysms, in light of its proﬁbrotic characteristics and extensive ECM degradation
involvement [88].
TGF- signaling has been implied to protect against abdominal and thoracic aortic
aneurysm formation, while systemic TGF- inhibition enhances abdominal aortic aneurysm
formation, whereas smooth muscle-cell speciﬁc TGF- neutralization can increase the
chances of aortic thoracic aneurysm development [ 92]. Furthermore, experimental TGF- 
hampering in mice has stimulated aneurysm formation, as well as multiple complications
associated with the disease [ 93]. However, contradictorily to those previous ﬁndings, the
inhibition of TGF- signaling in myeloid cells has been suggested by Hara et al. as a
potential therapeutic target in patients with Marfan syndrome [ 94]. Similarly, an increase
in serum TGF- has been correlated with the prognosis of thoracic aortic aneurysms, as
well as dissection evolvement, especially in those patients with Marfan syndrome [95,96].
Bicuspid aortic valve patients present a lower circulating TGF- than those with TAV ,
probably as a result of extracellular space sequestration [ 97]. However, a concomitant
genetic syndrome diagnosis in BAV patients has been associated with a higher circulat-
ing TGF- than the one depicted in subjects with non-syndromic BAV or TAV [ 98]. A
ratio between TGF- and endoglin (ENG) has been proposed as a biomarker of BAV
aortopathy [98]. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 4993 11 of 17
Pediatric studies have mainly focused on congenital cardiac disorders, as TGF- 
overexpression has been identiﬁed in populations with CHD, Marfan syndrome and aortic
dilatation [ 99–101]. The elevation of TGF- , MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels has been identiﬁed
in children after surgery for tetralogy of Fallot repair (TOF) [ 82]. A study published by
Shiina et al. also identiﬁed elevated TGF- 1 levels in patients with a repaired Fallot,
in association to increases in ascending aortic diameter along with other conventional
investigations, such as brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity [102].
In conclusion, the biomarker potential of TGF- in the prediction of aortic aneurysms
is still controversial, due to multiple studies showing contradicting results in terms of
expression variation. Still, TGF- helps in maintaining the equilibrium of the arterial wall
component through its inﬂuence on the ECM. The inﬂuence of TGF- on the ECM, its
effector pathways and intricate role with other molecular entities in the development of
aortic aneurysms has been highlighted in Figure 1.

2. Future Perspectives
The genetic basis of aortopathies still requires further research, but the discovery and
validation of novel molecules involved in the pathogenesis of aortic dilation and techno-
logical advances have created the premises for the depiction of their enzymatic activity,
mRNA expression and analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms’ implication. The
tissular expressions of several MMPs, TIMP-1, TIMP-3, ADMA and TGF- seem to be
altered in relation to aortic dilation and aneurysms [ 35,58]. Single nucleotide polymor-
phisms of key elements such as the nitric oxide synthase-3 enzyme (Nos3), IL-6, IL-1 ,
IL-10, angiotensin 1 receptor and angiotensin-converting enzyme have also been regarded
as potential biomarkers of aortic remodeling [ 56,103,104]. The main objectives of recent
studies have been to identify circulating biomarkers, but a correlation between circulating
and tissular biomarkers still requires clariﬁcation. Some authors have found, for exam-
ple, a positive correlation between circulating TGF- and tissular MMP-2 [ 98] or between Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 4993 12 of 17
circulating and tissular MMP-9 in abdominal aortic aneurysms [ 105], but research is still
pending. The validation of non-invasive biomarkers and future investigation of particular
genotypes might represent important steps towards the prognostic evaluation of incipient
and evolving aortic dilatation.
3. Conclusions
Multiple quantiﬁable serum signaling pathway-associated molecules have been as-
sessed for their potential biomarker role in the progression of aortic dilatation and pre-
diction of aneurysm formation and associated complications. MMPs have been by far
the most intensively researched, and most studies have focused on MMP-2 and MMP-9.
Furthermore, most data available in the literature have analyzed candidate biomarkers in
BAV , which is highly frequent among CHD. However, pediatric data is scarce, and further
studies are mandated to elucidate contradicting results and identify plasmatic biomarkers,
especially quantiﬁable at younger ages, as these can be closely followed up in the long term.

Purpose:  We assessed prenatal detection rates of congenital heart disease (CHD) and associations between maternal serum bio -
markers and non-chromosomal CHD in singleton pregnancies. 
Materials and Methods:  This study was conducted as a secondary analysis of data obtained during a multicenter prospective co -
hort study that investigated the cost-effectiveness of prenatal testing for fetal aneuploidy. We analyzed the prenatal detection rate 
and accuracy for CHD screening via ultrasound during the second trimester, as well as associations between serum biomarkers 
and CHDs, in singleton newborns without chromosomal abnormalities. 
Results:  Among 6715 women, 142 (2.1%) newborns were born with CHDs, of which 67 (1.0%) newborns had major CHDs. The 
prenatal detection rate for all CHDs and major CHDs were 34.5% and 58.2%, respectively. After excluding isolated ventricular sep -
tal defects, the detection rate for critical CHDs was 85.9%. Women with low pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) (<0.4 
multiples of the median, MOM) face increased risks of non-chromosomal CHDs [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.76; 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.36–5.13] and major CHDs (aOR 7.30; 95% CI 3.18–15.59), compared to those without CHDs. A higher inhibin A level 
(≥2.5 MOM; aOR 4.84; 95% CI 1.42–12.46) was associated with non-chromosomal major CHDs.
Conclusion:  Ultrasonography performed during the second trimester by obstetricians detected over 85% of critical CHDs. Low Original Article

Congenital Heart Disease and Maternal Serum Marker
https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2022.63.8.735INTRODUCTION
A major purpose of fetal sonographic evaluation is to detect 
congenital abnormalities to optimize counseling and care of 
the fetus. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common 
birth defect (4 to 13/1000 live births) with significant morbid -
ity, and it is considered to be the leading cause of infant death 
among congenital anomalies. Therefore, screening during the 
second trimester for CHD via ultrasonography is very important.1 
Prenatal diagnosis of critical CHD prior to planned neonatal 
cardiac surgery could reduce the risk of death from cardiovas -
cular compromise.2 In addition, the importance of interdisci -
plinary parental counseling for prenatally diagnosed congeni -
tal disease has been emphasized, especially for CHD.3,4 A recent 
study reported a significant increase in the possibility of delivery 
after severe CHD has been diagnosed prenatally and addressed 
via a multidisciplinary approach.4 
Many risk factors have been identified for CHD, including 
family history, teratogen exposure, known aneuploidy, and ma -
ternal diabetes, and more than 90% of cases occur in low-risk 
patients.5 The guidelines for fetal cardiac screening during sec -
ond-trimester anatomical ultrasound were developed by the In -
ternational Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 
(ISUOG) to improve antenatal detection rates and standardize 
fetal cardiac screening examinations.6 A nationwide study in 
Denmark demonstrated that mortality from major CHDs de -
creased significantly when general prenatal heart screening 
was conducted rather than selective prenatal heart screening.7 
Recent evidence suggests an association between abnormal 
placentation and CHDs in fetuses.8,9 Preeclampsia and CHDs 
have been found to exhibit positive associations with reduced 
levels of angiogenic biomarkers and increased levels of anti-an -
giogenic biomarkers in maternal serum or umbilical cord blood, 
with low placental weight, with abnormal umbilical cord inser -
tions, and with abnormal placental perfusion assessed by uter -
ine artery pulsatile index.8,9 However, further studies are re -
quired to elucidate the association between abnormal 
placentation markers and CHDs and to investigate an appro -
priate ultrasonographic screening protocol of the fetal heart 
during the second trimester.
Second-trimester prenatal screening had been performed by 
obstetricians in secondary or tertiary centers in South Korea. 
The goal of the present analysis was to evaluate detection rates 
and accuracy of ultrasound for CHD in the second trimester and associations for maternal serum biomarkers with risk of 
CHD without chromosomal abnormalities. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population 
This study was designed as a secondary analysis of a multicenter 
prospective cohort study in South Korea carried out from De -
cember 2016 to April 2018 at 12 different secondary or tertiary 
healthcare centers. The aforementioned study had assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of prenatal testing in women who were 
screened for fetal aneuploidy. The protocol of this prospective 
observational cohort study has been published.10 Pregnant 
women (<24 weeks) who had received counselling for fetal an -
euploidy testing were invited to enroll in the original study. The 
participants were stratified according to the risk of fetal chromo -
somal abnormalities based on previous pregnancy outcomes, 
maternal demographic findings, maternal serum screening 
(MSS) biomarkers, and fetal ultrasonographic findings, includ -
ing fetal nuchal translucency (NT), sonographic soft markers, 
and any suspicious congenital anomalies. The pregnancy out -
comes were recorded, including gestational age at delivery, 
neonatal birth weight, the presence of congenital anomalies, 
and postnatal cytogenetics. 
This secondary analysis included women with singleton preg -
nancies who underwent ultrasonography screening during the 
second trimester. Women with spontaneous abortions, termi -
nations, fetal death in utero, and follow-up loss were excluded. 
However, patients with terminations or those lost to follow-up 
after a prenatal diagnosis of major congenital anomaly were in -
cluded in the final analysis.
Neonatal outcomes and congenital anomalies
Newborn outcomes were determined via physical examination 
at birth or through any form of genetic testing and imaging. 
Newborns with a normal physical examination were consid -
ered to be euploid in the absence of genetic testing. Congenital 
anomalies were all considered as congenital disease as defined 
in the Korean Standard Classification of Disease, 7th edition 
(KCD-7, codes Q00–Q99), which have been modified from the 
ICD-10. CHDs were confirmed via postnatal echocardiography 
after birth to newborns suspected of having CHD based on 
prenatal ultrasound or postnatal diagnosis. CHD requiring sur -maternal serum PAPP-A or high inhibin-A was associated with non-chromosomal CHDs. These results may contribute to an im -
provement in prenatal diagnosis of CHDs.

drome, atrioventricular septal defect (VSD), double outlet 
right ventricle, double inlet ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot, trans -
position of the great arteries, situs inversus, Ebstein anomaly, 
pulmonary or aortic valve stenosis or atresia, mitral or tricuspid 
valve stenosis or atresia, abnormal pulmonary venous return, 
interrupted aortic arch, coarctation of the aorta, ectopia cordis, 
rhabdomyoma, cardiomegaly, and VSD were defined as the 
major CHDs in this study. Isolated atrial septal defects were ex -
cluded from consideration for major CHDs, and patent duc -
tus arteriosus and persistent foramen ovale were not consid -
ered as CHDs. 
Prenatal sonographic markers for congenital defect
Information was requested for all pregnant women regarding 
NT ultrasound, aneuploidy screening, and diagnostic testing 
for chromosomal abnormalities. For fetal NT, the measure -
ments performed between 11 and 13+6 gestational weeks were 
selected. Sonographic soft markers for CHDs, included choroid 
plexus cyst, echogenic bowel, echogenic intracardiac focus 
(EIF), short long bone, short or absence of nasal bone, increased 
nuchal fold, pyelectasis, single umbilical artery, and persistent 
right umbilical vein (PRUV).
Fetal aneuploidy screening, and diagnostic testing 
The screening tests for fetal aneuploidy included MSS or cell 
free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) screening. MSS included 
the Dual test [pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), 
total or free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)], Tri -
ple test [alpha fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), 
total hCG], Quad test (AFP , total hCG, uE3, inhibin A), inte -
grated test, and sequential test. The cfDNA screening analyzed 
for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 and sex chromosomal abnormality. 
The prenatal diagnostic tests included chorionic villus sampling 
and amniocentesis. When the screening test showed a positive 
result, counseling was performed on further evaluations. 
Statistical analysis
The detection rate for CHD was calculated as the number of 
CHDs suspected prenatally (live-born or terminated or follow-
up loss) divided by sum of CHD suspected prenatally and CHD 
not diagnosed in prenatal ultrasonogram. We calculated the 
sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value, and negative 
predictive value of prenatal screening ultrasound examinations 
in the second trimester for all CHDs.
After excluding chromosomal abnormalities, we compared 
maternal baseline characteristics, sonographic findings, and 
MSS according to the severity of CHDs. We categorized the ma -
ternal serum biomarkers according to multiples of the median 
(MOM) values for each of the markers as ≤2.5, ≤5.0, ≥95.0, and 
≥97.5th percentiles. For each biomarker’s cut-off, the associa -
tions between maternal serum biomarkers and non-chromo -
somal CHD were presented as odds ratios from logistic regres -sion analysis before and after adjustment for confounders.
We used a chi-squared test for categorical variables and anal -
ysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for continuous vari -
ables. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant in -
cluding for multiple testing. Statistical analysis was conducted 
using R package software (version 4.1.0; The R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://www.r-project.
org). 
The Institutional Review Boards of each participating institu -
tion, including College of Medicine, at the Catholic University 
of Korea (KC16ONMI0989), approved the original study of the 
KPDS, as was previously stated.10 We followed the ethical stan -
dards for human experimentation provided by the Declaration 
of Helsinki and obtained written consents from the participants.
RESULTS
A total of 6715 singleton pregnant women was enrolled in this 
original study. Among them, 6491 women underwent screening 
sonogram in the second trimester. After further excluding 95 
women [27 parental chromosomal abnormalities, 28 neonatal 
chromosomal abnormalities, 5 unknown birth outcomes with 
suspicion of CHDs (4 VSD, 1 left superior vena cava), and 35 fol -
low-up loss], a total of 6397 women was included in the final 
analysis (Fig. 1). 
A CHD was identified in 142 cases (2.2%), and 67 newborns 
(1.1%) were considered to have major CHDs postnatally. The 
detection rate of any CHDs was 34.5% [95% confidence inter -
val (CI) 26.7 –42.9], and that of major CHDs was 58.2% (95% CI 
45.5 –70.2) for a second trimester screening ultrasonogram. Af -
ter excluding isolated VSD (n=32), the detection rate of critical 
CHDs reached 85.7% (95% CI 69.7 –95.2). The sensitivity, speci -
ficity, and positive and negative predictive values for major 
CHDs in women who underwent screening ultrasonogram in 
the second trimester are listed in Table 1. Detection rates for 
mitral stenosis (0%, 95% CI 0 –97.5%) and pulmonary stenosis 
(PS) (25.0%, 95% CI 0.6 –80.6) were poor. The accompanying 
chromosomal abnormalities, prenatal suspicion, and birth 
outcomes for major CHD except isolated VSD are summa -
rized in Supplementary Table 1 (only online). 
The maternal baseline characteristics of the women with no 
confirmed neonatal chromosomal abnormality are presented 
in Table 2. Women with non-chromosomal CHDs had a lower 
gestational age at delivery, birthweight, and higher body mass 
index than those in the non-cardiac defect group. Women with 
non-chromosomal CHDs had significantly higher rates of a 
low education level, lower house income, overt diabetes, ges -
tational diabetes, and epilepsy, compared to the non-cardiac 
defect group (all p<0.05), but there was no difference between 
major CHDs and the control group (all p>0.05). Women with 
maternal CHDs had a higher rate of neonatal major CHDs than 
the control group. Preterm birth (20.2% vs. 6.3%, p<0.001) and  738

https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2022.63.8.735placental abruption (3.1% vs. 0.4%, p<0.001) occurred more fre -
quently in the CHDs group than in the control group. However, 
these differences were not found between the control group 
and the major CHD group (all p>0.05). 
Table 3 shows the sonographic findings and MSS according 
to individual CHDs. A thickened NT (≥2.5 mm and ≥3.0 mm) 
and an increased risk of neural tube defect (NTD) in MSS were 
significantly higher in women with any and with major CHDs, 
compared to women without CHDs. Sonographic soft markers 
including EIF (4.6% vs. 0.5%), pyelectasis (4.6%, vs. 1.7%), and 
single umbilical artery (3.8% vs. 0.4%) were more frequently 
observed in women with any CHDs than in the control group 
(all p<0.05, respectively). Women with major CHD had higher 
frequency of the increased nuchal fold (3.4% vs. 0.7%), pyelec -
tasis (6.8% vs. 1.7%), single umbilical artery (5.1% vs. 0.4%), and 
PRUV (1.7% vs. 0.1%) than women in the control group (all p< 
0.05). EIF in minor CHDs (8.5%) was significantly higher than 
that in the control group (0.5%, p<0.001), and there were no sig -
nificant differences between the major CHD group and the 
control group (0.0% vs. 0.5%, p>0.05).
Correlations between the maternal serum biomarkers and 
non-chromosomal CHD are presented in Table 4. Women with 
CHD had significantly lower PAPP-A, compared to those in the 
non-cardiac defect group, yielding an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 
of 5.21 (95% CI 2.34 –10.37) for the less than 2.5th percentile 
(0.311 MOM), 2.92 (95% CI 1.43 –5.42) for less than the 5th 
percentile (0.399 MOM), and 2.76 (95% CI 1.36 –5.13) for less 
than 0.4 MOM, respectively. Also, women with a lower level of 
first trimester PAPP-A had also a higher rate of major CHDs 
[aOR 12.77 (95% CI 4.94 –29.23) for less than 2.5th percentile, 
aOR 7.91 (95% CI 3.40 –16.95) for less than 5th percentile, and 
aOR 7.30 (95% CI 3.15 –15.59) for less than 0.4 MOM, respec -
tively]. In the second trimester, a high maternal serum AFP more than the 97.5th percentile was associated with increased 
risks of CHDs [aOR 2.80 (95% CI 1.07 –6.07)] and major CHDs 
[aOR 4.51 (95% CI 1.33 –11.47)]. Women with major CHDs had 
significantly higher inhibin-A levels, compared to those in the 
non-cardiac defect group, yielding an aOR of 4.48 (95% CI 
1.32 –11.53) for more than the 97.5th percentile (2.460 MOM) 
and 4.84 (95% CI 1.42 –12.46) for more than 2.5 MOM, respec -
tively. Other maternal serum analytes were not associated with 
non-chromosomal CHDs. 
In women with fetal isolated VSD or PS, low serum PAPP-A 
(≤0.4 MOM, 28.6% vs. 5.1%), high AFP (≥2.5 MOM, 6.9% vs. 
0.6%), and high inhibin-A (≥2.5 MOM, 11.5% vs. 2.1%) were 
associated with an increased risk of fetal CHD, yielding ORs of 
7.45 (95% CI 2.63–18.53), 11.61 (95% CI 1.83–40.92), and 6.05 
(95% CI 1.42–17.75), respectively. Also, in women with major 
fetal CHDs, except isolated VSD or PS, low serum PAPP-A (≤0.4 
MOM, 27.3% vs. 5.1%) and high AFP (≥2.5 MOM, 12.5% vs. 0.6%) 
were associated with an increased risk of fetal CHD, yielding 
ORs of 6.98 (95% CI 1.52–24.34) and 22.39 (95% CI 3.43–84.31), 
respectively. However, in women with major fetal CHDs ex -
cluding isolated VSD and PS, high maternal serum inhibin-A 
(≥2.5 MOM, 6.7% vs. 2.1%, p=0.745) was not associated with 
the risk of fetal CHD. 
DISCUSSION
This study found significant associations of both lower maternal 
serum PAPP-A in the first trimester and higher maternal serum 
AFP in second trimester with an increased risk of non-chromo -
somal CHD. Lower serum PAPP-A or higher AFP , as well as 
higher inhibin-A, were significantly more common in women 
with fetal major non-chromosomal CHD than those without fe -Table 4.  Correlations Between Maternal Serum Analytes and CHDs in the Study Population

The development processes of the heart and placenta share 
the same regulatory pathways, and placental dysfunction is 
considered to be a contributor to the development of CHD.11,12 
PAPP-A is an angiogenic biomarker produced mainly in placen -
tal trophoblasts, and low PAPP-A is associated with chromo -
somal anomalies.13,14 Previous studies have indicated that low 
maternal serum PAPP-A is associated with an increased risk of 
fetal CHD.15,16 This study also found that women with low PAPP-
A (≤0.4 MOM) in the first trimester had an increased risk of fetal 
non-chromosomal CHDs [aOR 2.76 (95% CI 1.36 –5.13)], and 
even a greater risk of major fetal CHDs [aOR 7.30 (95% CI 3.15–
15.59)]. More than one-fourth (28.1%) of major CHDs occurred 
in women with low PAPP-A levels less than 0.4 MOM. 
AFP is a major protein in fetal serum, and it increases in ma -
ternal serum for women with fetal integument defects.17 Data 
on the association between maternal serum AFP and fetal CHD, 
however, are discrepant across studies.18-20 In this study, women 
with a high AFP (>2.5 MOM, that is, cutoff for risk of NTD) had 
six-fold higher odds of CHD and 16-fold higher odds of major 
CHDs even without fetal integument defects. This finding is 
consistent with the study of Jelliffe-Pawlowski, et al.19 We sus -
pect that women with high serum AFP (≥2.5 MOM) may need 
detailed ultrasound examination not only for NTDs but also 
for CHDs. 
Inhibin A is a glycoprotein produced by the placenta and is 
associated with fetal Down syndrome.21 Previous studies have 
reported that an increase of inhibin A is associated with adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia, fetal growth re -
striction, and preterm birth.22,23 In contrast, there is limited in -
formation on the association between congenital malforma -
tion and an increased level of inhibin-A.23 This study found an 
association between maternal serum inhibin-A in the second 
trimester with major fetal CHDs, but not with overall fetal car -
diac defects. Women with high inhibin-A (≥2.5 MOM) had a 4.8-
fold (95% CI 1.42–12.46) increased risk of major non-chromo -
somal fetal CHDs. Since several studies have suggested shared 
pathways for development of the heart and placenta, it seems 
that increased levels of inhibin-A show a significant association 
with CHDs, although the causes and consequences are still un -
clear.24-26 In addition, severe isolated fetal CHDs have been 
found to be more likely associated with placental vascular mal -
perfusion, which were consistent with the result of this study.27,28 
In this study, prenatal detection rates of any CHD and ma -
jor CHDs were 34.5% and 58.2%, respectively. After excluding 
isolated VSD, the detection rate of major CHD reached 85.7%. 
PS (25%) and isolated VSD (28.1%) showed relatively low de -
tection rates. However, associations between maternal serum 
markers with fetal CHDs were consistent, even in women with 
fetal PS or isolated VSD. Although isolated PS is a relatively 
common form of CHD, with a prevalence of about 0.7 per 
1000 live births,29 the prenatal diagnosis of valvar PS has been 
reported to be as low as 3.2%.30,31 Since severe cyanosis and hy -poxia may develop in affected infants, the prenatal detection of 
PS is important to provide optimal care in a tertiary care hospi -
tal by administering prostaglandins to prevent closure of the 
ductus arteriosus in the neonatal period until definitive treat -
ment has been provided. The addition of a color Doppler eval -
uation of the fetal heart during routine second-trimester sonog -
raphy in low-risk patients had been reported to improve the 
detection rates for valvular abnormalities including PS.32,33 Our 
findings can be used to improve prenatal detection of isolated 
VSD and PS in a low-risk population. In women with low PAPP-
A, high AFP , or high inhibin-A, even if major heart abnormali -
ties are not found on detailed sonography in the second trimes -
ter, efforts might be continued to find CHDs including isolated 
VSD or PS using an additional ultrasonogram with or without 
color Doppler.
Different pathophysiologic pathways of fetal PS show various 
ultrasonographic presentations in the early mid-trimester, re -
sulting in some cases of missed diagnoses in mid-trimester ul -
trasonography.34 Although there was no case of fetal aortic ste -
nosis in this study, the prenatal detection of aortic stenosis is 
very difficult in the second trimester due to a relatively normal 
four-chamber view, and about 20% of critical aortic sternosis 
cases are diagnosed in the third trimester due to progressive left 
ventricular dysfunction and other physiologic aberrations, sug -
gestive of hemodynamically significant obstruction.35,36 Since 
some valvular abnormalities cannot be detected until at least 30 
gestational weeks, the fetal echocardiography guidelines in Ja -
pan suggest another fetal heart screening at approximately 30 
gestational weeks with the routine use of color Doppler.37 When 
women have abnormal serum screening markers, a detailed 
ultrasonogram in the third trimester needs to be discussed to 
improve prenatal detection of CHD, especially for those with 
a valvular disease.
Our study has some limitations. There were cases lost to fol -
low up and cases where prenatal diagnosis could not be vali -
dated, such as those terminated after diagnosis without an au -
topsy. Another limitation is that the sample size of our study is 
relatively small. A further large-scale prospective study is need -
ed to evaluate clinical applications and to assess risks accord -
ing to the type of CHDs. However, our study has the strength 
in its multicenter prospective nature. To our knowledge, this is 
the first study to show an association between maternal serum 
inhibin A and major CHD. Fetuses with CHDs are more vul -
nerable to a hypoxic environment, so there is increased impor -
tance in antenatal and postnatal development for CHD fetuses 
with placental malperfusion.38,39 This study can contribute to 
improving prenatal detection of CHD by selecting high risk 
mothers with maternal serum markers for aneuploidy. 
In conclusion, this study suggests that screening ultrasono -
gram performed at second trimester is useful in the prenatal 
diagnosis of critical CHDs and that abnormal maternal serum 
biomarkers of aneuploidy are associated with non-chromo -
somal CHDs. A detailed obstetric ultrasound or fetal echocar - 742

low PAPP-A (≤0.4 MOM) or with high AFP or inhibin A (≥2.5 
MOM) during second serum screening for aneuploidy. Prospec -
tive large-scale studies may be required to verify the predictive 
value of abnormal biomarkers in MSS and further detailed fe -

Abstract 
Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most prevalent birth defects in the world. The pathogen-
esis of CHD is complex and unclear. With the development of metabolomics technology, variations in metabolites 
may provide new clues about the causes of CHD and may serve as a biomarker during pregnancy.
Methods: Sixty-five amniotic fluid samples (28 cases and 37 controls) during the second and third trimesters were 
utilized in this study. The metabolomics of CHD and normal fetuses were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics tech-
nology. Differential comparison and randomForest were used to screen metabolic biomarkers.
Results: A total of 2472 metabolites were detected, and they were distributed differentially between the cases 
and controls. Setting the selection criteria of fold change (FC) ≥ 2, P value < 0.01 and variable importance for the 
projection (VIP) ≥ 1.5, we screened 118 differential metabolites. Within the prediction model by random forest, 
PE(MonoMe(11,5)/MonoMe(13,5)), N-feruloylserotonin and 2,6-di-tert-butylbenzoquinone showed good prediction 
effects. Differential metabolites were mainly concentrated in aldosterone synthesis and secretion, drug metabolism, 
nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathways, which may be related to the occurrence and development of 
CHD.
Conclusion: This study provides a new database of CHD metabolic biomarkers and mechanistic research. These 
results need to be further verified in larger samples.

What is already known about this topic?
The pathogenesis of congenital heart disease (CHD) 
is complex and unclear. Metabolomics could detect the 
changes in metabolites produced by biological systems, which may provide a new clue for CHD occurrence and 
serve as a biomarker for diagnosis.
What does this study add?
Metabolites in maternal amniotic fluid were distributed 
differentially between the CHD cases and controls. Dif -
ferential metabolites may serve as screening biomarkers. 
They were mainly concentrated in three key pathways.

development. CHD is one of the most prevalent of 
birth defects in the world [1]. The worldwide prevalence 
of CHD in live births was rising during the previous 
40 years and reached 9.41‰ during 2010–2017 [1]. The 
etiologies of CHD occurrence are complex. It is reported 
that less than 30% of CHDs are caused by clear environ -
mental or genetic factors, and the unknown causes are 
considered to be the result of interactions between envi -
ronmental and genetic factors [2, 3]. However, most of 
the influencing factors have not been fully confirmed utill 
now, and the teratogenic mechanism is still lacks suffi -
cient evidence, which seriously restricts the formulation 
and implementation of effective interventions for CHD. 
The cause and etiological mechanism of congenital heart 
disease have been studied for decades, but there is no 
obvious breakthrough providing a clear etiological mech -
anism. It is urgent to explore new ways to research the 
etiology of CHD from new perspectives and directions.
The heart is the first functional organ developed in the 
embryo. The primitive heart tube begins to form in the 
3rd week of the embryo and plays a role in circulation in 
the 4th week. By the 8th week, the atrial and ventricu -
lar septa are fully grown, and the connection of the fun -
dus arteries and veins is completed [4]. If it was affected 
by any teratogenic factors during this period, there may 
be abnormal development of the heart or large blood 
vessels.
Currently, the diagnosis of congenital heart disease 
is mainly concentrated in the second trimester, using 
ultrasound echocardiography. [5] However, the preci -
sion of CHD diagnosis is greatly limited by ultrasound 
technology in different hospitals [6, 7], and echocardi -
ography itself has some limitations [6, 8]. Some mild 
CHD subtypes, such as isolated coarctation of the aorta 
(CoA), could not be identified until after birth [9]. Fur -
thermore, CHD is not constant during pregnancy, and it 
may be dynamically change. For example, up to 60–80% 
of ventricular septal defects (VSD) can spontaneously 
recover [10, 11]. Therefore, whether a relatively objective 
inspection method could be developed to increase the 
prediction effect of CHD in later development needs be 
considered.
Metabolomics can quantitatively detect the changes 
in all metabolites produced by biological systems (cells, 
tissues or organisms) after external stimuli or genetic 
modification [12]. Metabolomics can discover disease-
related small molecule compounds by studying the 
internal changes of biological systems. Understand -
ing disease-specific metabolites provides a theoretical 
basis for exploring the pathogenesis of maternal–fetal 
diseases and searching for disease-related biomark -
ers [13, 14]. Metabolomics has been used in studies of 
congenital heart disease in recent years [15, 16]. The variable metabolites could provide important clues for 
exploring the pathogenesis and biomarkers of CHD.
Previous studies have used biological samples such as 
maternal serum [17], urine [18, 19], and amniotic fluid 
(AF) [20] to detect metabolites for exploring biomarkers 
of congenital heart disease. However, the types of detect -
able metabolites are limited. The results are inconsist -
ent, and the possible mechanism remains unclear. In this 
study, amniotic fluid in the second and third trimesters 
was used as the research material, and a new metabo -
lomic research method involving untargeted metabo -
lomic assays was used to analyze the specific metabolic 
markers in AF. At the same time, we explored the meta -
bolic mechanism of congenital heart disease to provide 
more research evidence.
Materials and methods
Study population and sampling
This project was based on a multicenter hospital-based 
case–control study. Pregnant women who underwent 
prenatal diagnosis during the second trimester were 
recruited from three hospitals in China [21]. Mothers 
whose fetuses were prenatally diagnosed with CHDs or 
without any anomalies were initially chosen as the cases 
and the controls, respectively. The phenotype was diag -
nosed by sonographers, pathologists, and pediatricians 
through systematic ultrasound, autopsy, or postnatal fol -
low-up [21, 22]. Cases were defined as isolated congenital 
heart disease without other extracardiac malformations, 
and controls were defined as fetuses without any congen -
ital anomalies.
A structured questionnaire-based interview was used 
to collect the subjects’ information after the pregnant 
women were signed informed consent [23, 24]. Dur -
ing the follow-up process, when the subjects needed 
to undergo amniocentesis for medical reasons, 5  ml of 
amniotic fluid was extracted in the amniocentesis proce -
dure with the woman’s consent. The amniotic fluid was 
centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored in aliquots 
at -70 °C until analysis. This study was approved by the 
Medical Ethics Committee of Sichuan University (ID: 
2,010,004) and West China Second University Hospital 
(ID: 2015(011)). All subjects provided informed consent 
to participate. Here, all samples and information were 
obtained from the project biobank. The subtypes of CHD 
cases are listed in Table  1. Both cases and controls were 
singletons without a family history of CHD.
Sample pretreatment
A 100 μL sample of Amniotic fluid supernatant was trans -
ferred to an EP tube, and added 400 μL of extraction solu -
tion (acetonitrile: methanol = 1: 1) (CNW Technologies) 
containing isotopically labeled internal standard mixture  Page 3 of 11
 Yuan et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders          (2022) 22:495 
 
was added. After vortexing, sonication, ice-water bath, 
incubated and centrifugation, 400μL of supernatant was 
transferred to a fresh glass vial and dried in a vacuum 
concentrator at 37 ℃ . Then, the dried samples were 
reconstituted in 200 μL of 50% acetonitrile, and the above 
steps repeated. 75 μL of supernatant was transferred to 
a fresh glass vial for LC/MS analysis. The quality control 
(QC) sample was prepared by mixing an equal aliquot of 
the supernatants from all of the samples.
Metabolomic measurements
Ultra (high) performance liquid chromatography 
(UHPLC) separation was carried out using an ExionLC 
Infinity series UHPLC System (AB Sciex), equipped with 
a UPLC BEH Amide column (2.1 × 100  mm, 1.7  μm, 
Waters). The mobile phase consisted of 25  mmol/L 
ammonium acetate and 25 mmol/L ammonia hydroxide 
( CNW Technologies) in water (pH = 9.75) (A) and ace -
tonitrile (B). The analysis was carried out with an elution 
gradient. The column temperature was 25℃. The autosa -
mpler temperature was 4 ℃, and the injection volume 
was 2 μL (pos) or 2 μL (neg), respectively.
TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometry (AB Sciex) was used 
for its ability to acquire MS/MS spectra on an informa -
tion-dependent basis (IDA) during LC/MS experiments. 
In this mode, the acquisition software (Analyst TF 1.7, AB 
Sciex) continuously evaluates the full scan survey MS data 
as it collects and triggers the acquisition of MS/MS spectra 
depending on preselected criteria. In each cycle, the most 
intensive 12 precursor ions with intensity above 100 were 
chosen for MS/MS at a collision energy (CE) of 30 eV. In 
the detection process, standard products and blank con -
trols were strictly used for quality control, and data qual -
ity control was also carried out. The UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis was performed at Biomarker Technologies Corpo -
ration, Beijing, China (https:// inter  natio nal. biocl oud. net/).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics
A case–control analysis was performed to assess the vari -
ations in metabolites on CHDs. The personalized features 
included maternal age, maternal prepregnancy body 
mass index (ppBMI), fetal sex (male, female), and gravid -
ity. Frequency was used to describe qualitative data, and 
continuous variables were described as quantitative data 
using the mean and SD. Differences in the frequencies of 
these factors between cases and controls were assessed 
using the chi-square test or Student’s t-test.
Metabolomics data processing
Mass spectrometry (MS) raw data (.wiff) files were con -
verted to the mzXML format by ProteoWizard. The 
process including peak deconvolution, alignment and 
integration, was processed by R package XCMS (version 
3.2). Minfrac and cut off are set as 0.5 and 0.3 respec -
tively. In-house MS2 database was applied for metabolite 
identification.
Metabolomics data were analyzed using SIMCA-
P14.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) software for differen -
tially grouped principal component analysis (PCA), fold 
change (FC) analysis, orthogonal partial least squares 
discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and unsupervised clus -
tering analysis. Dimensionality reduction and sorting 
of metabolites were performed to screen for differential 
metabolites. The methods of combining the multiple of 
FC, the P value of the Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney rank 
sum test, the variable importance for the projection (VIP) 
value of the OPLS-DA model and the multivariate logis -
tic regression analysis were used to screen the differential 
metabolites and mapping.
Metabolic biomarker screening
The random forest (RF) method was used to select the 
most influential markers. RF was implemented using the 
‘randomForest’ function from the ‘randomForest’ pack -
age in R [25]. In addition, a receiver operating charac -
teristic (ROC) curve was used to estimate the area under 
the curve (AUC) score and 95% confidence interval (95% 
CI) of each selected marker. A logistic regression model 
including these selected markers was conducted, and 
the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian infor -
mation criterion (BIC), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), 
Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and AUC score were 
used to estimate the performance of the model for clas -
sifying the subjects. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model.Table 1 The subtypes of CHD cases

Metabolic pathway analysis
The classification information of differential metabolites 
was annotated by using the HMDB (Human Metabolome 
Database, https:// hmdb. ca/) and KEGG ((Kyoto Ency -
clopedia of Genes and Genomes, https:// www. kegg. jp/) 
databases. Enrichment analysis and statistical drawing of 
the annotated differential metabolites were performed.
All analyses were carried out using R version 3.6.1 (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, http:// www.r- 
proje  ct. org). Two-tailed values of P < 0.05 were consid -
ered significant.
Results
Major characteristics of the participants
After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria to 
subjects with qualified biological samples, 65 amniotic 
fluid samples (28 cases and 37 controls) were ultimately 
recruited in the present study.
The demographic characteristics are listed in Table  2 
and the individual information of the 28 CHDs are listed 
in Appendix Table S1. The proportions of gestational age 
and fetal sex were significantly different between the case 
and control groups (p < 0.05) (Table 2).
Metabolomics detection results
Sixty-five samples were subjected to untargeted metab -
olomic assays, and a total of 2472 metabolites were 
identified. All metabolites were evaluated by princi -
pal component analysis (PCA), sample cluster analysis 
and repeated correlation evaluation. The distribution 
of metabolites between the case and control groups is 
shown in Fig. 1A, Band Figure S1A/B.
Orthogonal projections to latent structures-discrimi -
nant analysis (OPLS-DA) of differential groups of cases 
and controls was performed to obtain more reliable 
information on the degree of correlation between group 
differences in metabolites and experimental groups. In 
this model, R2Y was 0.984, and Q2 was 0.692. The results 
were shown inFig.  1C, D. The OPLS-DA results showed 
that there was a significant difference in metabolic pro -
files between CHD patients and controls in AF.
Biomarker screening and validation
Differential metabolite screening
For subjects with biological replicates, the method of 
combining the fold change (FC), the P value of the t-test 
and the VIP value of the OPLS-DA model was used to 
screen the differential metabolites. The screening criteria 
were FC > 2, P value < 0.01, and VIP > 1.50. A total of 118 
differential metabolites were screened, of which 59 were 
upregulated and 59 were downregulated (listed in Table 
S2). The results are shown with the volcano map in Fig -
ure S1C.Results of randomforest
The more values below the detection limit, the less accu -
rate the representation of the metabolite may be. Hence, 
we selected the candidate markers, with a detection value 
of 0 in less than 10% of subjects and 36 markers were 
selected from the 118 markers. Then, we selected 10 
markers with an average VIP ≥ 1.8 as the most influential 
markers for the following analysis.
When the number of decision trees (ntree) was 38, 
and the number of variables contained in each decision 
tree (mtry) was 9, the out-of-bag error was minor and 
tended to stabilize (Figure S2, Figure S3). As is shown in 
Fig.  2, meta_1461 emerged as the most important input 
variable, followed by meta_1587 and meta_901 (all of the 
above markers have a Mean Decrease Accuracy > 4.0). 
Less important variables included meta_838, meta_1024, 
meta_1195, meta_2137, meta_2373, meta_1261, and 
meta_1354 (all of these markers have a Mean Decrease Table 2 Comparison of demographic characteristics between

Accuracy < 4.0). We used a logistic regression model

(AUC score: 85.6%, 95% CI: 76.1%, 95.2%), followed by

(Fig. 3 A).
The ROC curve of the model is shown in Fig.  3B, with an 
AUC score of 98.8%. Furthermore we also performed a sen -
sitivity analysis with some covariates in the logistic regres -
sion model, such as: maternal age, maternal prepregnancy 
Body Mass Index (ppBMI), fetal sex (boy, girl), and the 
number of pregnancy times. The AUC score (99.5%) of the 
adjusted model (with covariates adjusted in the model) was 
similar to that (98.8%) of the model without any covariates 
adjusted. The AIC decreased from 25.15 to 23.68, and the 
BIC increased from 33.85 to 38.90 (Fig. 3 B).
In summary, the metabolite biomarker screening pro -
cess and results were showed in Fig. 4.
Metabolic pathway analysis
Differential metabolites were annotated by the KEGG 
(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database 
and HMDB (Human Metabolome Database). The hyper -
geometric test was used in ClusterProfiler to perform 
enrichment analysis on the annotation results of the 
KEGG differential metabolites [26]. The results showed 
that the differential metabolites were mainly concen -
trated in glycerophospholipids, fatty acyls and prenol 
lipids (Fig.  5A). These metabolites were enriched in 
aldosterone synthesis and secretion, drug metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathways 
(Fig. 5B).
Discussion
In this study, the distribution characteristics of amniotic 
fluid metabolites in CHDs and the controls were obtained 
through untargeted metabolomics detection. Possible 
biomarkers for CHD occurrence or development were 
screened. We also explored the possible mechanisms for 
differential metabolites in the occurrence of CHD. Our 
results provide basic data resources into congenital heart 
disease from a new perspective.
Congenital heart disease is one of the most common 
birth defects [1], and the diagnosis of the disease is overly 
dependent on the technical level of ultrasonography [5].
Metabolomics is an extension of genomics that can 
more intuitively reflect the profiling of metabolites in 
biofluids, cells and tissues and it is routinely applied as 
a tool for biomarker discovery [27]. Owing to innovative 
developments in informatics and analytical technologies 
and the integration of orthogonal biological approaches, 
it has become possible to expand metabolomic analyses 
to understand the systems-level effects of metabolites, 
which can be used for CHD screening or to explore the 
mechanism of occurrence and development of CHD.

A previousstudy conducted a serum metabolomics 
study on children with congenital heart disease and 
found that 13 metabolites showed a significant increasing 
or decreasing trend. Taurine, glutamine, and glutamate 
presented considerable diagnostic value for the diagno -
sis of CHD [16]. Some researchers performed metabo -
lomics detection on the serum of patients with congenital 
bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and controls [15]. A predic -
tive model for estimating group BAV was established and 
those studies supported the value of serum-based metab -
olomic profiling methods as an adjunct tool for screening 
large populations.
However, these studies used infant or childhood serum 
samples as material to explore the relationship between metabolites and CHD, and it is relatively rare to study the 
occurrence of CHD through biological samples obtained 
from pregnant mothers. Previous studies reported 
that maternal serum [17], urine [18, 19], and amniotic 
fluid (AF) [20] were used to detect metabolites by [1] H 
NMR or GC–MS technology. However, these methods 
for detecting metabolites are more limited than those 
detected by UHPLC‒MS.
Amniotic fluid, as the growing environment of the 
fetus, is relatively stable in the middle and late pregnancy 
stages. Compared with maternal blood, urine and other 
samples, it can better reflect the actual metabolic state of 
the fetus. The urine excreted by the fetus after the sec -
ond trimester is an important source of amniotic fluid,

and the metabolites in the fetus will be reflected in the 
amniotic fluid with the excretion of urine. The sources of 
amniotic fluid in the second and third trimesters are basi -
cally similar. Amniotic fluid not only provides a mechani -
cal buffer for the fetus to prevent limb adhesion but also 
provides nutrients and growth factors, transports metab -
olites, and more. At the same time, the physiological and 
biochemical levels of the amniotic fluid reflect the health 
status of the fetus. Accurate and sensitive details of birth 
defect-related metabolites and their respective biochemi -
cal pathways can be obtained through amniotic fluid 
metabolomics, which also allows a better understanding 
of the overall pathophysiology of affected pregnancies.
A total of 2472 metabolites were identified using the 
UHPLC-QTOF-MS untargeted metabolomics detection in this study. Many new metabolites were found com -
pared to previous studies, which mostly used NMR or 
GC-TOF–MS methods, and could only detect hundreds 
of metabolites [17–20]. UHPLC is increasingly displac -
ing conventional high performance liquid chromatogra -
phy [28] LC–MS is the main workhorse of metabolomics 
owing to its high degree of analytical sensitivity and 
specificity when measuring diverse chemistry in complex 
biological samples [29]. The untargeted metabolomics 
detection method can identify as many metabolites as 
possible by comparing characteristic peak ions with 
standard databases, and useing semiquantitative metab -
olite content to obtain high-throughput metabolomics 
data [ 28]. Untargeted metabolomics is a powerful tool 
that can provide new clues for prenatal diagnosis [14]

。It will be helpful for discovering affected metabolic 
pathways, revealing disease pathogenesis, and identifying 
potential biomarkers [27].
The method of combining the fold change, the P value 
of the t-test and the VIP value of the OPLS-DA model 
was utilized to screen the differential metabolites, 
and the machine algorithm of randomForest (RF) was 
exploited to screen the biomarkers. The randomForest is 
an ensemble learning method that operates by construct -
ing a collection of decision trees [30], and for variable 
selection, it performs well across sample sizes [31]. In 
addition, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) 
score and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each 
selected marker. We also evaluated the combined differ -
entuation ability of these makers using a logistic regres -
sion model. The results show that PE(MonoMe(11,5)/
MonoMe(13,5)), 4-[N-(p-Coumaroyl) serotonin-4’’-yl] 
-N-feruloylserotonin and 2,6-Di-tert-butylbenzoquinone 
in maternal amniotic fluid perform well in distinguishing 
cases from controls.
PE(MonoMe(11,5)/MonoMe(13,5)), also called 
13-(3-methyl-5-pentylfuran-2-yl) tridecanoate, a kind 
of dimethylfuran fatty acid, is abundant in fish oil and is 
easily oxidized and degraded [32]. There are few reports 
about this chemical, but it has been found to be decreased 
in patients with gastrointestinal diseases [33]. 4-[N-(p-
Coumaroyl)serotonin-4’’-yl]-N-feruloylserotonin is a 
serotonin derivative with a trace distribution in medici -
nal plants such as safflower [23]. It has strong scavenging 
free radicals and anti-lipid peroxidation ability, antitumor 
activity, anti-inflammatory and bacteriostatic effects, and it inhibits the production of melanin and other functional 
activities. This substance has the potential for the study 
of atherosclerosis and aortic wall distention [24]. 2,6-Di-
tert-butylbenzoquinone, a cyclic NIAS originating from 
food packaging, has not been found to be associated 
with disease occurrence. However, a similar substance 
2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone, is a revers -
ible inhibitor of cardiac cells through intracellular  Ca2+ 
handling in ventricular myocytes [34]. Among the ten 
most important metabolites, methylglutarylcarnitine was 
also reported detected differentially in CHD patients and 
controls [17]. Deficiency of 3- methylglutarylcarnitine 
affects the metabolism of leucine as well as ketogenesis. 
This disorder is one of an increasing list of inborn errors 
of metabolism that present clinically, such as metabolic 
syndrome (MetS), risk of developing cardiovascular dis -
ease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes [35].
This study found that the differential metabolites were 
mainly concentrated in several metabolic pathways, and 
it was inferred that aldosterone synthesis, drug metabo -
lism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism played 
very important roles in the occurrence and develop -
ment of CHD. The secretion of aldosterone is mainly 
regulated by renin-angiotensin, a hormone that regu -
lates the blood volume in the human body. It maintains 
water balance by regulating the reabsorption of sodium 
in kidneys. Excessive circulating and tissue angiotensin II 
(AngII) and aldosterone levels lead to a profibrotic, pro -
inflammatory, and hypertrophic milieu [36] that causes 
remodeling and dysfunction of cardiovascular and renal 
tissues [37]. Nicotinate and nicotinamide are collectively 
referred to as vitamin 22. Nicotinamide forms coenzyme

I and coenzyme II with ribose, phosphate and adenine in 
the body. They are the coenzymes of many dehydroge -
nases and are associated with many metabolic processes 
including glucose glycolysis, fat metabolism, and pyru -
vate metabolism, which are closely related to the forma -
tion of high-energy phosphate bonds [38]. As the major 
coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phospho -
rylation and a substrate for enzyme responses to energy 
stress and oxidative stress, nicotinamide adenine dinu -
cleotide (NAD +) is emerging as a metabolic target in a 
number of diseases including heart failure. Niacin turns 
into niacinamide in the body to play the above role. In 
addition, niacin also has a strong peripheral vasodilator 
effect. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is syn -
thesized de novo from tryptophan through the kynure -
nine pathway. The patients showed treduced levels of 
circulating NAD. Defects similar to those in the patients 
developed in the embryos of Haao-null or Kynu-null 
mice owing to NAD deficiency. The prevention of NAD 
deficiency during gestation could prevent these defects 
[39]. These results would provide additional new metabo -
lite data sources for the CHD, and suggest a new idea for 
further mechanistic exploration of CHD.
Of course, this study also has some shortcomings: the 
sample size is relatively small, and the metabolite dif -
ferences between CHD subtypes could not be analyzed 
comparatively. The basic characteristics the of cases 
and controls are somewhat inconsistent due to the lim -
ited collection of samples in biobanks, which may inter -
fere with the results. In addition, only internal data were 
used in the validation model, and no external database 
was used for verification. Future studies should focus on 
larger sample sizes for in-depth analysis and validation. 
This study will provide certain directions and ideas for 
future studies.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015. All rights reserved.Background:  Most congenital heart diseases (CHDs) 
have specific hemodynamics, including volume and
 
pressure overload, as well as cyanosis and pulmonary 
hypertension, associated with anatomical abnormalities. Such hemodynamic abnormalities can cause activation of neurohormones, inflammatory cytokines, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells, which in turn contribute to the development of pathologic conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy, ﬁ  brosis, and cardiac cell damages and death. 
Measuring biomarker levels facilitates the prediction of these pathological changes, and provides information about the stress placed on the myocardial cells, the severity of the damage, the responses of neurohumoral factors, and the remodeling of the ventricle. Compared to the ample information on cardiac biomarkers in adult heart diseases, data from children with CHD are still limited.
Data sources: We reviewed cardiac biomarkers-speci ﬁ cally 
focusing on tr
oponin as a biomarker of myocardial damage, 
amino-terminal procollagen type III peptide (PIIIP) as a biomarker of myocardial ﬁ brosis and stromal remodeling, 
and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal proBNP as biomarkers of cardiac load and heart failure, by introducing relevant publications, including our own, on pediatric CHD patients as well as adults.
Results: Levels of highly sensitive troponin I are 
elevated in patients with atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular
 septal defects (VSDs). PIIIP levels are also 
elevated in patients with ASD, VSD, pulmonary stenosis, and Tetralogy of Fallot. Measurement of BNP and N-terminal proBNP levels shows good correlation with heart failure score in children.Conclusions: In the treatment of children with CHD 
r
equiring delicate care, it is vital to know the speci ﬁ c degree 
of myocardial damage and severity of heart failure. Cardiac biomarkers are useful tools for ascertaining the condition of CHDs with ease and are likely to be useful in determining the appropriate care of pediatric cardiology patients.

IntroductionMost congenital heart diseases (CHDs) have 
specific hemodynamics, including volume and pressure overload, as well as cyanosis 
and pulmonary hypertension (PH), associated with anatomical abnormalities. These overloads can result 
in necrosis, apoptosis, and mechanical stressors, such as direct pressure and stretching of myocardial cells, which are believed to cause myocardial damage (Fig. 1). When the myocardium incurs the 
aforementioned overload, various compensatory mechanisms work to maintain cardiac function. One of these compensatory mechanisms is cardiac hypertrophy due to an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system.
[1] Furthermore, myocardial 
damage may result in myocardial localization of inflammatory cytokines and cause activation of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells.
[2,3] Growth 
signals from tissue growth factors and angiotensin-II induce the production of amino-terminal procollagen type III peptide (PIIIP), which is the most frequently and extensively studied marker of tissue fibrogenesis. PIIIP is cleaved off during conversion from type III procollagen to type III collagen in the ﬁ broblasts, and is 
subsequently released into the bloodstream.
[4]
Cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis are 
compensatory mechanisms of heart failure (HF). In the early stage, HF is compensated by increasing cardiac output; however, persistent HF may trigger a vicious cycle in which the ventricle must work against a greater Cardiac biomarkers in children with congenital heart disease

load, which in turn may lead to further deterioration of 
ventricular function. Biomarker measurements facilitate the prediction of the pathological condition, including what stress is placed on the myocardial cells, how much damage is incurred, how neurohumoral factors respond, and how the ventricle has been remodeled.
However, information about various types of cardiac 
biomarkers is still limited in children with CHD as compared to that in adults. Therefore, to help deepen our 
understanding of cardiac biomarkers in pediatric CHD patients, we reviewed this topic—speci ﬁ cally focusing 
on 1) troponin as a biomarker of myocardial damage, 2) PIIIP as a biomarker of myocardial ﬁ brosis and stromal 
remodeling, and 3) B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) as biomarkers of HF—by introducing relevant publications, including our own, on pediatric CHD patients as well as adults.
Biomarker of myocardial cell damage: 
troponin
Biomarkers used in the diagnosis of myocardial 
damage include creatine kinase (CK), creatinine kinase MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, and heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), all of which are present in the cytoplasm-soluble fraction, and troponin T (TnT), troponin I (TnI), and myosin light chain, which constitute myofibrils. TnT, TnI, and H-FABP are present inside the myocardial cells, but may infiltrate the bloodstream if the myocardial cells are damaged. These biomarkers, especially TnT and TnI, have high specificity, and newly developed rapid measurement kits have been recently utilized in clinical practice in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
[5,6] The guidelines on the 
diagnosis of AMI published in 2010 by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology emphasize the importance of elevated troponin levels instead of elevated CK and CK-MB levels, which were previously used.
[7]
TnT and TnI may be detected in the blood 3-4 hours 
after the onset of AMI, and may therefore be useful in the early diagnosis of AMI.
[5] The recent development 
of a second-generation high-sensitivity troponin assay has not only increased the accuracy of AMI diagnosis, but also made it possible to diagnose slight myocardial ischemia, which has been imperceptible to date. An examination of adults revealed that blood TnT and TnI levels correlated with the degree of severity of HF and were more useful than NT-proBNP levels as prognostic factors of cardiovascular events.
[8] Moreover, serum 
TnI levels were also found to be increased in patients without AMI or HF, and were elevated in 75% of patients who received treatment in the intensive care unit for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis.
[9,10] It has been suggested that systemic 
inflammatory enzymes, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α), interleukin (IL) 6, and reactive oxygen 
species, may cause myocardial damage.
[11] Moreover, 
elevated TnI levels are found in 40% of patients with acute pulmonary embolism.
[12] It is assumed 
that myocardial damage is caused by hypoxia and a pressure overload on the right ventricle due to sudden elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. In addition, it has been reported that in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the TnI levels signi ﬁ cantly increase as 
the myocardial wall thickens.
[13]
Upon examining serum TnI levels in children, 
we found that the cutoff value in healthy children was 0.014 ng/mL, whereas the cutoff value in adults was known at 0.04 ng/mL.
[14] In adults, the serum 
troponin level is thought to be increased by silent HF, invisible cardiovascular stress, and renal dysfunction; it is moreover known to increase with aging.
[15] 
Furthermore, upon measuring troponin levels in pediatric patients with left-to-right shunt [atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs)], Fig. 1. Cardiac biomarkers and mechanisms of cardiac loading and 
hypoxia that cause heart failure in congenital heart diseases. PIIIP:

World J Pediatr, Vol 11 No 4 . November 15, 2015 . www.wjpch.comwe found signi ﬁ cantly elevated levels of TnT and TnI. 
These results suggest that ventricular volume overload 
may cause myocardial damage. Moreover, children with VSDs were found to have much higher levels of TnT and TnI than children with ASDs, and the TnT and TnI levels showed a good positive correlation with the pulmonary-to-systemic blood pressure ratio (Pp/Ps), which suggests that, in addition to ventricular volume overload, right ventricular pressure overload may also damage the myocardium. Accordingly, Eerola et al
[16] 
reported that in CHD, ventricular pressure and volume 
overload might increase the TnI levels. Moreover, it has been reported that patients with CHD-related PH have increased levels of TnT.
[17] Thus, the measurement of 
high-sensitivity troponin facilitates the early diagnosis of AMI; meanwhile, in the ﬁ eld of pediatric cardiology, 
it may also reflect silent myocardial damage due to pressure or volume overload, and is a useful tool in the management of CHD and for ascertaining the patients' condition.
Biomarker of myocardial ﬁ brosis and 
interstitial remodeling: PIIIP
In the event of ischemic myocardial necrosis and 
apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines and tissue growth factors activate the growth of fibroblasts, and thus collagen metabolism (Fig. 1).
[18] Furthermore, physical 
stressors, such as that caused by myocardial pressure 
and stretch overload, induce the production of angiotensin II, and consequently lead to the growth of fibroblasts via angiotensin I receptors.
[2] PIIIP is a 
protein in the blood that reflects collagen metabolism in the tissues, and its expression has long been known to be increased in patients with HF. PIIIP levels increase after treatment of HF, even in mild HF, and are thus utilized as a marker of myocardial remodeling to determine and predict prognosis.
[19-21] Moreover, PIIIP 
has also gained attention as a marker of ventricular 
diastolic dysfunction.[22]
In a previous study by our group, the PIIIP level was 
found to be elevated owing to various hemodynamics in children with CHD.
[23] In children with VSDs or ASDs 
exhibiting ventricular volume overload, the PIIIP level 
was found to correlate with the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs), whereas in children with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the PIIIP level was found to correlate with the degree of cyanosis. Moreover, we also found that the PIIIP levels were inhibited by 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
Similar to adults, the RAA system in children 
has been reported to be involved in the development 
of myocardial fibrosis. Lai et al
[24] reported that following surgery for TOF, a good correlation was 
observed between mechanical dyssynchrony of the left 
ventricle and PIIIP expression. The degree of diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle and the PIIIP levels have been reported to be well correlated in children with dilated cardiomyopathy, and additional reports have indicated that the degree of coronary stenosis in the late period of Kawasaki disease and elevated PIIIP levels are correlated as well.
[25,26] Accordingly, in the treatment 
of children with cardiovascular disease, we believe that 
the PIIIP level is a useful tool to ascertain the state of myocardial ﬁ brosis and associated ventricular function.
Biomarkers of HF: BNP and NT-proBNP
The neurohumoral factors, noradrenalin, the RAA 
system, endothelin, IL-6, and TNF- α are activated and 
they play key roles in the formation of HF. However, these neurohumoral factors interrelate and are difficult to be measured, as their blood serum levels tend to change often, and as they are unstable substances. Therefore, it is not practical to use the blood serum levels of these factors for diagnosis and treatment monitoring.
Various stressors that impact myocardial cells 
induce the production of proBNP, which breaks down into BNP and NT-proBNP, which are in turn secreted into the bloodstream.
[27] BNP is a protein 
responsible for inducing physiological activities such as diuretic effects, vasodilator actions, and inhibition of myocardial remodeling.
[28] In contrast, NT-proBNP is a 
protein without any physiological activity that is highly stable, with a longer half-life than BNP (approximately 70 minutes vs. 5 minutes).
[29] During childhood, both 
BNP and NT-proBNP levels decrease with increasing age, and the levels are known to be particularly high during the neonatal period.
[30-33] In our previous studies, 
we used Ross scores instead of the New York Heart 
Association functional classification system used in adults to objectively evaluate the symptoms of HF in children,
[34,35] excluding in neonates, and compared 
their sensitivity and specificity with those of BNP and 
NT-proBNP levels.[36] We found that, as the grade of 
cardiac HF progressed, the BNP and NT-proBNP levels significantly increased (Fig. 2A&B). Moreover, in the event of grade 2 or higher HF, the sensitivity and specificity of NT-proBNP were superior to those of BNP (Fig. 3A&B). The receiver operating characteristic curves for the BNP and NT-proBNP levels with respect to grade 2 and higher congestive HF are shown in Fig. 3. The reasons for why the NT-proBNP level is associated with a larger area under the curve than BNP are likely differences in metabolism, stability, and  312World Journal of Pediatrics

Because renal function is closely associated with HF, NT-proBNP may indicate severity more subtly.
[37]
Several reports[38-40] have compared elevated BNP 
and NT-proBNP levels according to different CHDs. In heart disease due to a left-to-right shunt, such as ASDs and VSDs, NT-proBNP levels are high when the Qp/Qs is high, and the fact that this decreases after surgery indicates that congestive HF due to volume overload may result in increased NT-proBNP levels.
[41-43] Moreover, right ventricular volume overload 
due to pulmonary regurgitation after surgery for TOF also leads to increased NT-proBNP levels.[44,45] NT-proBNP 
levels have been reported as a useful marker of HF in patients with single ventricular circulation after Fontan surgery.
[46-48] Accordingly, in the treatment of CHD, 
measurement of BNP and NT-proBNP levels is a useful tool to evaluate HF, to determine the effectiveness of therapeutic agents, and to identify the need for surgical intervention.
Other possible biomarkers of HF, such as fraction 
of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a well-established biomarker of airway inflammation and response to pharmacological treatment in patients with asthma,

World J Pediatr, Vol 11 No 4 . November 15, 2015 . www.wjpch.comF2, isoprostanes are known to be reliable biomarkers 
of oxidative stress;[50] they should also be studied in 
children with CHD. Increased FENO concentrations 
after exercise in adult patients with chronic systolic HF associated with pulmonary hypertension
[51] as well 
as increased urinary F2-isoprostane concentrations in patients with non-ischemic congestive HF have been 
reported.
[52]
Others: PH markers associated with CHD
CHD may be accompanied by PH due to anatomical abnormalities, and several attempts have been made to evaluate PH by using biomarkers.
[53] Sanli et al[54] 
measured homocysteine and asymmetric dimethyl 
arginine levels in 30 children with PH associated with CHD. However, although both biomarkers were elevated in patients with PH, they did not correlate with the pulmonary artery pressure determined via echocardiography and catheterization. Moreover, many reports
[55,56] have indicated that BNP and NT-proBNP 
levels are elevated in adult patients with PH, and recent 
reports[57] similarly indicate that children with CHD-
induced PH also have elevated NT-proBNP levels. 
Van Albaba et al[58] examined 29 children with PH and 
reported that NT-proBNP, uric acid, adrenalin, and noradrenalin levels were all useful in determining the therapeutic outcomes and in evaluating the prognosis. We have previously reported that TnI levels and Pp/Ps correlated well; however, our results may have included right ventricular pressure overload and left ventricular volume overload, as patients with VSDs and PH had high TnI levels (Fig. 3).
[14] A biomarker that can be used 
directly to detect the high resistance of the pulmonary 
vascular bed is being investigated; however, at present, 
no innovative markers have been found, and further 
developments are anticipated.
Conclusions
Most CHDs present specific hemodynamics, including volume and pressure overload, as well as cyanosis and PH, associated with anatomical abnormalities. While these hemodynamics may be evaluated by using various imaging tests and cardiac catheterization, the measurement of serum biomarkers has recently played an important role in the evaluation of hemodynamics. 
The benefits of biomarkers are as follows: 1) they can be objectively evaluated as numerical values; 2) they have high reproducibility; 3) they can be repeatedly measured; 4) they do not require expert skills in diagnostic techniques; 5) they are less invasive and more safe compared to diagnostic methods that subject patients to radiation exposure; and 6) they can be easily measured 
without expensive specialized equipment or facilities. Accordingly, the measurement of biomarkers is likely to become more common in the treatment of CHD.

ABSTRACT
Objective: To identify maternal second and third trimester urine metabolomic biomarkers for
the detection of fetal congenital heart defects (CHDs).
Study design: This was a prospective study. Metabolomic analysis of randomly collected mater-
nal urine was performed, comparing pregnancies with isolated, non-syndromic CHDs versus
unaffected controls. Mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography and direct injection and tandem
mass spectrometry, LC –MS–MS) as well as nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry,1HN M R ,
were used to perform the analyses between 14 0/7 and 37 0/7 weeks gestation. A total of 36
CHD cases and 41 controls were compared. Predictive algorithms using urine markers alone orcombined with, clinical and ultrasound (US) (four-chamber view) predictors were developed
and compared.
Results: A total of 222 metabolites were identified, of which 16 were overlapping between the
two platforms. Twenty-three metabolite concentrations were found in significantly altered in
CHD gestations on univariate analysis. The concentration of methionine was most significantlyaltered. A predictive algorithm combining metabolites (histamine, choline, glucose, formate,
methionine, and carnitine) plus US four-chamber view achieved an AUC ¼0.894; 95% CI,
0814 –0.973 with a sensitivity of 83.8% and specificity of 87.8%. Enrichment pathway analysis
identified several lipid related pathways that are dysregulated in CHD, including phospholipid
biosynthesis, phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis, and fatty
acid metabolism. This could be consistent with the increased risk of CHD in diabetic
pregnancies.
Conclusions: We report a novel, noninvasive approach, based on the analysis of maternal urine
for isolated CHD detection. Further, the dysregulation of lipid- and folate metabolism appears to
support prior data on the mechanism of CHD.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common
major congenital anomaly. The overall estimated
prevalence is 6 –12 per 1000 live births [ 1–3], with up
to 50% being severe defects [ 4]. CHD is a major cause
of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide
[5,6] and the leading hospital expense for the pediatric
population [ 7].
Current national guidelines for the prenatal screen-
ing of CHD are limited to ultrasound (US), and princi-
pally based on the second trimester visualization of
the four-chamber view and outflow-tracts [ 8].
Population screening studies indicate that prenatal
detection rates for CHD remain low at 30 –50% [ 2,9].Higher rates are achieved in risk groups evaluated at
specialist referral centers [ 10]. Clinical predictors such
as family history, maternal diabetes, and IVF preg-
nancy status are widely used risk tools that generally
perform poorly [ 11] increasing the reliance on the US
scan. Screening based on prenatal US has a number ofsignificant limitations, however. Ultrasound accuracy islimited by operator expertise, equipment quality,
maternal obesity, and fetal position, with the latter
factors being beyond the control of evaluator. Second,since the majority of cases arise from low-risk popula-tions with no identifiable risk factors, they may notundergo skilled sonographic evaluation lowering the
detection rates [ 12]. Prenatal diagnosis of some major

morbidity, and mortality in the newborn [ 13,14] which
emphasizes the value of early detection.
Metabolomics refers to the comprehensive identifi-
cation and quantification of metabolites, i.e. low
molecular weight substances that constitute the sub-strates, intermediates, and by-products of cellular
metabolism [ 15]. Both the characterization and the
quantification of the individual metabolite help pro-vide integrative information on biological functions
and disease processes. Ultimately, metabolomics has
the potential for improving clinical care including inthe development of disease biomarkers [ 16,17].
In a recent publication, we identified several mater-
nal first trimester serum metabolomic biomarkers, pri-
marily lipids, that accurately predicted CHD [ 18]. A
recent study from China was published by Xie et al.[19], in which maternal urine metabolites were investi-
gated in pregnancies complicated by CHD, specifically
in the second and third trimester. Significant distur-bances in short-chain fatty acids and aromatic amino
acid metabolism were found. As urine has the appeal
of being noninvasively and conveniently obtained andavailable in abundant quantities, we therefore eval-uated the screening performance of urine metabolites
for CHD detection. Furthermore, because systematic
cardiac US evaluation is largely limited to at and insome cases after the mid-trimester, we were interested
in determining whether metabolite screening comple-
mented standard sonographic markers.
Materials and methods
Patient population
This was a prospective case-control study conductedat William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI.Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (#2017-145)was provided by that institution and patients provided
written consent before participation. We enrolled 80
women between 5/2017 and 11/2018. Inclusion criteriaincluded singleton pregnant women, between the
ages of 18 and 50 years old with isolated structural
cardiac malformations that were subsequently con-firmed prenatally and/or postnatally. Controls ( n¼41)
included gestational age-matched singleton pregnan-
cies (gestational age within 2 weeks of the index CHDcase) with no cardiac or other suspected congenital
anomalies. Exclusion criteria included pregnancies
complicated by aneuploidy, extracardiac defects, multi-fetal gestation, and those who lacked the capacity to
provide informed consent.Expert opinion generally recommends a minimum
of 30 cases and 30 controls for a proof-of-conceptmetabolomic study.
Data and sample collection and processing
Maternal clinical and demographic data such as age,race, BMI, gravidity and parity, gestational age at samplecollection, pregnancy complications, medical history,social history, family history, medications, and type ofcardiac malformation, including newborn determinationof cardiac findings were recorded. Urine samples wereprovided in a sterile receptacle at the point of care bythe patients. The protocols for urine sample processing,
1H NMR and targeted LC –MS–MS analysis and metabolite
identification is described in the Supplemental material .
The results of the standard four-chamber view of
the heart were recorded in our cohort. This is theanchoring sonographic cardiac screening view and isuniversally used and relatively easy to obtain, making
it a potentially attractive screening test. We collected
two to three pictures of four-chamber views fromcases and controls which were independentlyreviewed and classified as either normal or abnormalby a maternal fetal medicine specialist (A.W.) who wasblinded to the fetal or postnatal diagnosis.
Statistical analysis
Using MetaboAnalyst (v4.0) [ 20], Student ’st-test was per-
formed to compare metabolite concentrations betweenCHD and controls. In the case of non-normal distribu-tions, the Mann –Whitney Ut e s tw a su s e dt oc a l c u l a t e
significance ( p<.05). Demographic and clinical variables
were also compared in a similar fashion between CHDand control groups based on their data distribution. Forcontinuous variables, data were summarized using
means (SD), median and interquartile ranges (IQR), and
for categorical data, frequencies and percentages wereused. Multivariate analytical techniques that were usedto identify metabolites that differ between pregnancieswith CHD and controls that were age matched, included:principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and logistic regressionanalysis. These yield score plots that make the variance
between the groups easily visible with corresponding
loadings explaining differences in metabolite concentra-tions and allowing rapid identification of possible dis-ease biomarkers. Prior to performing PCA and PLS-DA,all data were normalized using quantile normalizationfollowed by log transformation and autoscaling [ 20].
Models were cross validated using permutation testing2 P. FRIEDMAN ET AL. (2000 iterations) to determine if the separation observed
in the representative scores plots was statistically signifi-cant. The most discriminatory metabolites were identi-
fied using the variable importance in projection
(VIP) plot.
Logistic regression analysis was performed with step-
wise variable selection to optimize all the model com-ponents. Least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator was used for the selection of predictor varia-
bles in the regression models [ 21]. Subsequently, a k-
fold cross-validation technique was utilized to ensurethe generalizability of a logistic regression model. Thiswas achieved by randomly dividing the entire sample
data into kequal sized subsets, of which only one is
used as the validation data for the model, and theremaining as training sets. Optimal and robust predict-ive algorithms were generated [ 22]. Model performance
was determined based on the calculation of area underthe receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and
the sensitivity and specificity values. In addition to the
metabolite only algorithm, we also developed predictivemodels which incorporated patient demographic andother clinical (including US) information.
Metabolite set enrichment analysis
Biologically meaningful patterns in metabolomic pro-file of CHD were identified using a metabolite setenrichment analysis (MSEA) in MetaboAnalyst [ 20].MSEA determines whether a group of functionally
related metabolites in each biochemical pathway aresignificantly perturbed using the concentration data. Ithas the advantage of identifying smaller but persistentchanges which would escape recognition with the use
of more standard pathway analysis approaches [ 20].
The Homo sapiens pathway library was utilized and all
the metabolites in the selected pathways were usedwhen referencing the specific metabolome. The foldenrichment and pvalues ( <.05) were used to generate
a bar graph to visually present the MSEA results.
Results
There was a total of 36 CHD and 41 controls used inthe study. Three cases were excluded (one sample dueto subsequent diagnosis of aneuploidy and two follow-ing outlier detection testing, which were significantlydifferent). Supplemental Table S1 provides the break-
down of the types of CHD cases that were recruited.
The maternal demographics and clinical variables of
the groups are compared in Table 1 . Clinical and demo-
graphic variables were not significantly different betweengroups. We identified 87 metabolites using DI-LC –MS/MS
and 135 metabolites with
1H NMR in urine specimen.
There were 16 overlapping metabolites between the twoplatforms and duplicate measurements were removedfrom further analysis. The mean (±SD) concentrations ofmetabolites ( lM) acquired using DI-LC –MS/MS and

lites, 66 (30.8%) metabolites demonstrated lower concen-
trations in maternal urine of CHD versus controls. There
was a total of 23 metabolites with statistically significant
differences in urine concentrations ( pvalue <.05)
between groups. Glucose, methionine, Isoleucine, valine,
methionine sulfoxide, and tryptophan were the top six
significant ( p<.05) metabolites on univariate analysis.
Supplemental Figure 1 displays the results of the
PLS-DA analysis. While visual separation was observed
between the groups; however, permutation testing
using 2000 repeats did not achieve statistical signifi-cance ( p¼.608). Failure to achieve statistical significance
is very likely due to the relatively small number of cases
compared to the number of metabolites being analyzed
in the study. The VIP plot ranking metabolites for their
power to discriminate CHD cases from controls is showninFigure 1 . Methionine, sphingomyelin C16:0, isobutyric
acid, 3-methylhistidine, and putrescine appeared to be
the best predictors of CHD based on the VIP scores
(value displayed on the x-axis).
Table 2 shows the regression models and their pre-
dictive performance. The models were: demographic
factors alone, four-chamber view alone, and metabo-lites alone as well as metabolites combined with
demographic and/or four-chamber view. The metabol-
ite only model consisting of glutarate, glucose, cho-
line, methionine, formate, and aminobutyrate achievedan AUC (95% CI) ¼0.815 (0.711 –0.919), sensitivity
80.6%, and specificity of 78.0%. The top performing
model, which combined the US four-chamber view
with the metabolite ’s histamine, choline, glucose, for-
mate, methionine, and carnitine achieved excellentpredictive accuracy with an AUC (95% CI) ¼0.894
(0814 –0.973), and a sensitivity of 83.8% and specificity
of 87.8%. The incorporation of a combination ofdemographic and clinical factors (listed in Table 1 )t o

the best performing metabolite model, model 5.
In the subgroup of patients in which complete
post-natal follow up and confirmation was available
for 28 CHD cases (eight patients elected for termin-ation) the combination of glucose, aminobutyrate,methionine, formate, and four-chamber view achieved
an AUC (95% CI) ¼0.801 (0.69 –0.911), sensitivity 82.1%,
and specificity of 68.3% for CHD detection (Table S3).
Metabolite set enrichment analysis revealed multiple
metabolic pathways that were significantly perturbed in
maternal urine collected from CHD cases. Supplemental

cantly affected in CHD cases. Supplemental Figure 2 dis-

phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis.
Discussion
Principle findings
In this prospective study, we report the detection of
fetal isolated non-syndromic CHD based on targeted
metabolomic analysis of maternal urine. In addition,
we combined a single US marker the four-chamberview to further improve CHD detection.

Urine glutarate, glucose, choline, methionine, formate,
and aminobutyrate achieved an AUC (95% CI) ¼0.815
(0.711 –0.919), sensitivity 80.6%, and specificity of
78.0%. The combination of the four-chamber view
with urine metabolites histamine, choline, glucose, for-
mate, methionine, and carnitine achieved excellentpredictive accuracy for CHD with an AUC (95%
CI)¼0.894 (0.814 –0.973) and a sensitivity of 83.8% and
specificity of 87.8%. The addition of commonly utilizedmaternal risk and demographic factors did not further
improve the performance of the metabolite models.
The robust predictive accuracy of the metabolite mod-els suggests the potential value of maternal urine
metabolomics for the detection of fetal CHD.
We utilized the four-chamber view because of its rela-
tive simplicity of acquisition and wide current deploy-
ment in clinical practice. In our cohort, conventionalfour-chamber view by itself was judged to be abnormal
in only 33% of the CHD cases by blinded observers.
Clinical implications
Beyond biomarker generation, a strength of metabolo-
mic analysis is the mechanistic insights it can provide
into disease pathogenesis. We therefore investigate the
potential mechanisms of isolated CHD. Based on theVIP plot, elevated levels of methionine appeared to be
the most significant metabolite for distinguishing CHD
from controls. The folate pathway has previously beendescribed as an important in CHD development.
Methionine is initially activated by ATP to S-adenosyl-
methionine, which is then converted to S-adenosylho-mocysteine (SAH) with the donation of a methyl group
needed for DNA methylation. SAH is a potent inhibitorof cellular methyl transferases which are responsible for
gene methylation, a mechanism for altering gene tran-
scription during organogenesis, cell differentiation, andapoptosis [ 23]. All of these mechanisms are important
in cardiac embryogenesis and their perturbation canlead to the development of CHD. Injection of embry-onic chick heart with homocysteine, a product of SAHmetabolism, leads to the development of CHD and thephenotype can be rescued with methionine [ 24]. Also,
prior studies, of women who previously had a childwith CHD were shown to have lower serum levels ofmethionine in the non-pregnant state [ 25–27]. In con-
trast, a recent study from pediatric patients with con-genital heart disease showed elevated levels of
methionine on serum analysis [ 28]. Population supple-
mentation with folate, the source of the methyl grouprequired for the conversion of homocysteine to methio-nine and for DNA methylation, has been associatedwith reduction in the levels of CHD in the population[29]. Together these studies suggest an important role
of methionine metabolism in the pathogenesis of atleast some types of CHD.
Lipid dysregulation has long been linked to congeni-
tal heart disease. Our enrichment pathway analysis iden-
tified several lipid-related pathways that aredysregulated in CHD cases. We found that the most sig-nificantly perturbed pathways in CHD involved phospho-lipid biosynthesis, PC biosynthesis, PE biosynthesis,and fatty acid metabolism ( Supplemental Table 4 ).
These perturbations in lipid metabolism were also con-cordant with our previous metabolomics study of firsttrimester maternal serum CHD prediction, where signifi-cant abnormalities in the levels of serum acylcarnitineswere reported [ 18]. Phospholipid production is essential
for cellular integrity related to cell membrane architec-ture as well as numerous chemical reactions and otherTable 2. Comparison of metabolite algorithms using1H NMR and DI-LC –MS/MS: congenital heart diseasea.

bFollowing 10-fold cross-validation.THE JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE 5 important functions [ 30]. The two most abundant phos-
pholipids in mammalian cells are PC and PE comprising
40–50% and 20 –50%, respectively of total phospholipids
[31]. In particular, perturbed PC biosynthesis in myocytes
increases fragility, making them less resistant to mechan-
ical stress [ 32] and prone to apoptosis [ 33]. The second
most predominant glycerophospholipid, PE has many
cellular functions, including promotion of membrane
fusion, protein integration into membrane, conform-
ational changes in proteins, and maximum mitochon-
drial respiratory function [ 34]. In addition, it is also a
precursor for PC. Dysregulation of PE biosynthesis has
been shown to result in an increased activation of sterolregulatory element binding protein (SREBP) [ 35].
Increased concentration of SREBP, a membrane tran-
scription factor that control lipogenesis, has been linked
to lipid induced cardiac dysfunction in flies, similar to
that found in diabetic hearts [ 36]. A second metabolic
pathway related to PE biosynthesis is by conversion of
phosphatidylserine (PS) to PE by mitochondrial enzymePS decarboxylase [ 31]. These two metabolically related
aminophospholipids typically reside in the inner leaflet
of the membrane bilayer in equilibrium, providing mem-
brane stability. In a mechanism that is not well under-
stood, cellular damage leads to relocation of PS to the
outer cellular membrane as a result of reduced amino-
phospholipid translocase and increase scramblase activ-i t y .S u r f a c ee x p o s u r eo fP Si so n eo ft h er e c o g n i t i o n
signals by which apoptotic cells are remove by phago-
cytes [ 31]. Perturbed lipid biosynthesis clearly plays a
unique role in the integrity of cellular membranes and
vital signaling pathways. The developing fetal heart is
comprised of different cardiac compartments with differ-
ent embryonic lines (the cardiogenic crescent cellsderived from the mesoderm germ layer and the cardiac
neural crest cells from the ectoderm germ layer), which
undergo numerous cell differentiation and fusion steps
[37]. It is possible that during this complex morphogen-
esis, perturbation of lipid biosynthesis that results in an
altered PS:PE within the cellular membrane can disrupt
the membrane integrity, or cause cellular apoptosis,leading to complex CHDs.
Strengths and limitations
There are several strengths of this study. First, we uti-lized and combined two metabolomics platforms,
namely
1H NMR and DI-LC –MS/MS, maximizing the
number of metabolites that could be studied. This isin comparison to Xie et al. [ 19], in which a single plat-
form gas chromatography –mass spectrometry (GC –MS)
as used. Second, we effectively combined urinemetabolomics with US evaluation, the core feature of
the current clinical standard for sonographic detection
of CHD. This combined approach for CHD prediction
has not been previously reported. Lastly, urine is anabundant resource, readily available, noninvasive
obtained thus improving patient compliance plus and
storage is simple. Further, it does not require costlypreparations. Thus, urine analysis is an ideal screen-ing test.
This study is not without limitations. A larger sam-
ple size could possibly have identified other significantmetabolites and pathways associated with CHD.
Similarly, the power to find significance for other pre-
dictive models was limited. Nonetheless, preliminarydata yielded good predictive accuracy for CHD.
Further, we ensured the generalizability of our results
by performing stringent cross-validation testing.Finally, the use of other US markers such as outflow
tract assessment might have improved model per-
formance. We purposefully excluded more compli-cated sonographic assessments such as the outflow
tracts as these can sometimes exceed the capabilities
of many individuals providing primary obstetric care inthe trenches. Reliance on more complicated clinicalskills has the undesirable consequence of limiting a
tools deployment in the general population, a primary
objective of screening protocols.
Conclusions
We reported mid- and third-trimester maternal urinebiomarkers for the detection of non-syndromic fetalCHD. We also identified biochemical perturbationsinvolving lipid metabolism which includes phospho-
lipid biosynthesis, PC biosynthesis, PE biosynthesis,
and fatty acid metabolism which could be involved inthe development of these CHDs. Metabolomics is a
rapidly developing science that could further enhance
our understanding of CHD mechanism as shown inthis approach while promising to generate novel and
accurate biomarkers and will allow accurate and early
diagnosis. Validation of our study results in a largercohort is an essential next step.

of fetal CHD is completely dependent on ultrasound testing, but only ∼40% of CHD
can be detected. The purpose of this study is to ﬁnd good bioma rkers in amniotic

least square discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) demonstra ted that CHD and control
samples had signiﬁcantly different metabolic proﬁles. Two metabolites, uric acid and
proline, were signiﬁcantly elevated in CHD and veriﬁed in tw o data sets. Uric acid was
associatedwithCHD[oddsratio(OR):7.69(95%CI:1.18–50. 13)inthediscoverysetand
3.24 (95% CI:1.62–6.48) in the validation set]. Additional ly, uric acid showed moderate
predictive power; the area under curve (AUC) was 0.890 in the discovery set and 0.741
in the validation set. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of uri c acid to detect CHD was,
respectively, 94.4 and 74.3% in the discovery set and 67.9 an d 71.9% in the validation

INTRODUCTION
Congenitalheartdisease(CHD)isthemostcommonbirthdefe ctthatisdeﬁnedasacardiovascular
malformation caused by abnormal vascular dysplasia during f etal development ( 1). CHD aﬀects
about 1% of live births and has become the leading cause of chi ldhood mortality ( 2,3). Despite
incomplete knowledge on the onset and development of CHD, rece nt ﬁndings indicate that Li et al. Biomarker of Congenital Heart Disease
intrauterine infection, environmental factors, chromoso mal
abnormalities, gene mutations and epigenetics are involved
in this disease ( 4–7). CHD phenotypes are diverse, involving
pulmonary stenosis, aortic stenosis, atrial septal defect, a ortic
transposition, right ventricular double outlet, ventricul ar septal
defect, patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, and o ther
types of defects ( 8). The impact of CHD on patients is diﬀerent
due to severity, and severe CHD may aﬀect the survival and
quality of life of patients ( 9,10). The prenatal diagnosis of fetal
CHD is completely dependent on ultrasound testing, but the
accuracy is aﬀected by various factors, such as tester experti se,
equipment quality, fetal position, and maternal obesity. CHD
type is another important factor aﬀecting detection, and most
CHD is not discovered until after the birth ( 11). Only∼40% of
CHD can be detected by prenatal ultrasound ( 12). If as many
CHD patients as possible can be detected early in pregnancy,
this will be helpful for this group of people to conduct prenatal
consultation, receive timely obstetric management, procee d
postpartum diagnosis and treatment, which may improve the
treatment eﬀect and quality of life. However, due to the low
detectionrate,theexplorationofCHD-relatedbiomarkersi sstill
urgentlyneeded.
The concept of metabolomics was ﬁrstly proposed by
Nicholson et al. ( 13). Metabolomics is widely used in the ﬁeld
of life science to study endogenous metabolites of the whole
bodyandtheirchanges( 14).Metabolomicsprovidesthemethods
for the identiﬁcation of the changes in the metabolite proﬁle s
of biological ﬂuid to support early biomarker discovery, dise ase
diagnosisandtreatment( 15).Severalmetabolomicsstudieshave
focusedonfetalCHD,andwesummarizedthesestudiesasshow n
inTable1. In these studies, the types of samples used were
maternal serum, maternal urine and amniotic ﬂuid (AF), and
the methods used were direct injection/liquid chromatogra phy
and tandem mass spectrometry (DI/LC-MS/MS), tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
(GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ( 16–20).
However, studies of fetal CHD based on amniotic ﬂuid
metabolomicsremainslimitedduetotheavailabilityofAF. Even
in the two studies with AF listed in Table1, the number of
CHD cases was small ( 16,17). AF contains amniotic epithelial
cells and numerous metabolites produced by fetal and placenta
tissues, which can reﬂect pathological condition during fet al
development ( 21). As a basic study, AF in the second trimester
was selected for analysis, and the main component of AF
was fetal urine in the second trimester ( 22). Compared with
blood and urine of pregnant woman, AF was less aﬀected by
factors and its composition was relatively simple, so it was
beneﬁcial for us to search for markers. Although AF acquisit ion
is invasive and not suitable for widespread use, if we can
conﬁrm a metabolic proﬁling diﬀerence of CHD in AF and ﬁnd
some eﬀective markers, this will guide us to further explore
CHD markers in blood of pregnant woman, and to explore a
detective method, which is even suitable for a wider population .
Untargeted metabolomics provides a comprehensive analysis of
all endogenous metabolites, therefore, it is feasible to uti lize
AF and metabolomics methods to detect CHD. In this study,
global metabolite proﬁles were analyzed in 71 AF samples fromCHDpregnancies.AlterationsinAFmetabolitesandbiomarker s
of CHD were analyzed, which may provide important clue
in understanding the pathogenesis of CHD and developing
detectivemarkersofCHD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples
Ethical approval of this study was obtained from the Medical
Ethics Committee of Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care
Hospital and a waiver of informed consent was approved. This
study wasaretrospectiveanalysis.AFsamplesusedinthisstud y
were collected from residual AF of patients visiting the prena tal
diagnosis center at the Nanjing Maternity and Child Health
Care Hospital between January 2012 and December 2018; the
specimens were stored at −80◦C. Among the 1,859 AF samples,
71 cases of CHD and 149 control samples were selected. The
casesofCHDweresinglepregnanciesfromtheJiangsuprovince
diagnosed as CHD by fetal echocardiogram and referred to our
prenatal diagnosis center. In 30 cases of CHD, the pregnancy
was terminated. The parents did not consent to autopsy due to
cultural norms; therefore, CHD diagnosis was based on prenata l
echocardiography only. In the 41 cases of CHD that resulted in
a live birth, postnatal ultrasound diagnosis was consistent wit h
prenatal results. Cases with structural malformations othe r than
CHD,chromosomalabnormalities,andpregnancycomplication s
such as hypertension and diabetes were excluded. Control
samplescorrespondedtonormalsinglepregnancieswithnormal
fetuses in which amniocentesis was performed due to advanced
age or an abnormal result of serological screening for Down
syndrome in the second trimester. The patients were from the
same geographic regions as the CHD cases, and postpartum
follow-up of these pregnancies was normal. Cases of CHD
or other structural malformations, chromosomal abnormali ties,
pregnancy complications, such as hypertension and diabetes,
wereexcludedfromthecontrolgroup.
Theselectedsamplesweredividedintotwoindependentsets:
the discovery set and the validation set. The discovery set o f AF
samples consisted of 18 CHD samples and 35 controls sample,
while the validation set consisted of 53 CHD samples and 114
controls. CHD was classiﬁed according to the method of Botto
etal.(23)(Table2).
In order to detect CHD serum biomarkers, 29 CHD and 58
control cases with matched GA, maternal age and BMI (body
mass index) were selected from 86,120 samples we saved after
serologicalscreeningforDownsyndromeinthesecondtrime ster
in our center from August 2016 to December 2019 ( Table3).
Fetal information and all outcomes were obtained through
follow-up. Other selection and exclusion criteria were basica lly

chloroform, and acetone were purchased from Thermo-Fisher
Scientiﬁc (FairLawn, NJ, USA). Ultrapure water was produced
by a Milli-Q reference system equipped with a LC-MS Pak
ﬁlter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). A time-of-ﬂight mass
spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) system (Pegasus HT, Leco Corp.,
St. Joseph, MO, USA) was equipped with an Agilent 7890B
gas chromatography and a Gerstel multipurpose sample MPS2
with dual heads (Gerstel, Muehlheim, Germany). Separation
was achieved on a Rxi-5ms capillary column (30m ×250µm
i.d., 0.25 µm ﬁlm thickness, Restek Corporation, Bellefonte,
PA, USA). A Beckman Coulter AU5800 automatic biochemical
analyzer (Brea, CA, USA) and a uric acid biochemical assay
kit [DiaSys Diagnostic Systems (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shang hai,
China]wereusedforserumuricaciddetection.
Sample Preparation for GC/TOF-MS
The metabolomics analysis was performed on XploreMET
platform (Metabo-Proﬁle, Shanghai, China) as previously
described ( 24,25). Brieﬂy, the frozen AF samples were thawed
on ice and centrifuged at 1,000g for 3min at 4◦C. Each aliquot
of 100 µL of AF sample was pipetted into a precooled EP
tube, and 10 µL of internal standard solution was added. Each
200µL of precooled methanol:chloroform (3:1, v/v) was used
for metabolite extraction. After centrifugation at 13,000 g for
20min at 4◦C, 200 µL of supernatant was carefully transferred
into an autosampler vial (Agilent Technologies, Foster City ,
CA, USA). The remaining supernatant from each sample was
pooled to make quality control (QC) samples. All the samples
in autosampler vials were centrifuged for 5min in a vacuum
centrifuge concentrator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) to
remove the chloroform solvent, transferred to a freeze drye r(Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) and completely lyophilized.
Dichloromethanewasaddedtothelyophilizedresiduetoensu re
complete dryness of the sample. The dried powder was put at
room temperature and ﬁlled with high-purity nitrogen (Parker
Balston, Lancaster, NY, USA). The sample derivatization and
injection were performed by a robotic multipurpose sample
MPS2 with dual heads (Gerstel, Muehlheim, Germany) as
follows: the addition of 50 µL of methoxyamine (20 mg/mL in
pyridine) to the dried sample at 30◦C for 2h, followed by the
additionof50 µLofMSTFA(1%TMCS)containingFAMEs,and
mixingat37.5◦Cfor1h.Inparallel,thederivatizedsampleswere
injectedwithsampleinjectionheadafterderivatization.
GC/TOF-MS Analysis Conditions
The 5% bonded and cross-linked diphenyl/95% dimethyl
polysiloxane (Agilent J&W Scientiﬁc, Folsom, CA, USA) with
helium (99.9999%) was used as the carrier gas at a constant ﬂow
rate of 1.0 mL/min. The temperature of both the injection and
transfer interfaces was 270◦C. The injection volume was 1 µL.
The GC temperature programming was set to 2min isothermal
heating at 80◦C, followed by 12◦C/min oven temperature ramps
to80–300◦C,4.5minto300◦C,and40◦C/minto300–320◦C,and
ﬁnal maintenance at 320◦C for 1min. In the TOF MS setting,
the measurements were made using electron impact ionization
(70eV) in the full scan mode (m/z 50–500), ion source was set
to 220◦C, with an acquisition rate of 25 spectra/s, and the mass
range was set to 50–500 Da. QC sample was analyzed across the

analyzer and a uric acid biochemical assay kit according to t he
manufacturer’s protocol. Standards, reagent blank and quali ty
control samples were analyzed at the same time, then uric acid
concentration of the samples was calculated according to the
standard curve. The basic principle of uric acid analysis was as
follows: (1) uric acid reacted with uricase to produce hydrog en
peroxide, carbon dioxide and allantoin; (2) through the acti on
of oxidase, hydrogen peroxide reacted with 4-aminoantipyrin e
and N-ethyl-N-(hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-m-toluidine (TOOS) to
produce blue-purple indamide; (3) the absorbance value was

by comparing the retention indices and mass spectral data
with JiaLib metabolite database ( 26,27). Each data set was

RESULTS
Study Population
Maternal age of CHD and control cases in the discovery set
ranged from 23 to 37 years (median, 29.5) and from 20 to 37
years (median, 29), respectively. Corresponding values in th e
validation set were 22 to 39 years (median, 28) and 21 to 42
years (median, 31) years. Gestational age (GA) of CHD and
control cases in the discovery set ranged from 23 to 30 weeks
(median, 27) and 18 to 28 weeks (median, 20), respectively.
Corresponding values in the validation set were 20 to 26 weeks
(median, 24) and 17 to 24 weeks (median, 20). The numbers of
female/male CHD and control fetuses were, respectively, 10/8
and 16/19 in the discovery set and 20/33 and 65/49 in the
validation set. There were no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀer ences
in the maternal age ( P=0.972) and fetal gender ( P=0.497)
between CHD and control cases in the discovery set, but GA
was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ( P<0.001). There were statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the maternal age ( P<0.001), fetal
gender (P=0.020), and GA ( P<0.001) between CHD
and control cases in the validation set. Except for terminate d
pregnancies, all CHD cases were diagnosed postpartum, and all
controlsampleswereCHD-free.
Metabolic Proﬁles of AF
Metabolic proﬁles of AF samples from CHD and control of the
discovery set and the validation set were analyzed by OPLS-D A
model.AclearseparationofthemetabolicproﬁlesbetweenCHD
and the control group could be observed in the discovery set
(R2Y=0.787,Q2Y=0.520,Figure1A ),andinthevalidationset
(R2Y=0.651,Q2Y=0.469,Figure1B ).Inaddition,permutation
testing was used to validate the classiﬁcation model, and P-
values of the discovery set and the validation set were both
signiﬁcant( P<5e−04).
Biomarker Selection of CHD
To identify potential biomarkers, we adjusted the metabolic
proﬁles for gestational age, maternal age, and fetal gender
using logistic regression analysis. This approach identiﬁed
a total of 9 diﬀerential metabolites in the discovery set
(SupplementaryTable1 ). Subsequently, we veriﬁed 2
diﬀerential metabolites, i.e., uric acid and proline, in the
validation set ( SupplementaryTable2 ), both showing increased

in the validation set. These results showed that uric acid an d
prolinewerepositivelycorrelatedwiththeriskofCHD.
To further explore the eﬀect of GA on uric acid and proline
levels, we analyzed the original data without the adjustmen t for
GA, maternal age, and fetal gender. The results demonstrate d
that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the level of uric
acid and proline at diﬀerent gestational weeks in controls in
the discovery and the validation sets ( Figures2A a,c,Ba,c) (P
>0.05). The absence of diﬀerences was also observed in CHD
cases (Figures2A b,d,Bb,d). There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in the proline level between controls and CHD ( Figure2C a).
However, the uric acid level was signiﬁcantly elevated in CH D
cases(Figure2C b)inbothsets.Theseresultsindicatedthatthere
was no signiﬁcant relationship between proline and uric acid
levelsandGAwithintherangeweinvestigated.
Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve
Analysis
In order to test the performance of the veriﬁed diﬀerential
metabolites in predicting CHD, we performed ROC curve
analysis for each indicator and their combination in detect ingCHD. ROC curves of uric acid in the discovery set ( Figure3A a)
andthevalidationset( Figure3B a)showedamoderatepredictive
power; the area under curve (AUC) was 0.890 (95% CI: 0.804–
0.977) and 0.741 (95% CI: 0.659–0.823), sensitivity was 94.4
and 67.9%, and speciﬁcity was 74.3 and 71.9%, respectively.
The ability of proline to detect CHD was low; the AUC of the
discovery set and the validation set was 0.579 (95% CI: 0.397 –
0.762) and 0.485 (95% CI: 0.395–0.575), the sensitivity was 3 3.3
and 88.7%, and the speciﬁcity was 91.4 and 18.4%, respectively
(Figures3A b,Bb).Logisticregressionanalysisdemonstratedthat
thecombinationofprolineanduricacidisnotasgoodpredictor
of CHD as uric acid alone. The AUCs of the discovery set
(Figure3A c)andthevalidationset( Figure3B c)were0.844(95%
CI: 0.733–0.956) and 0.713 (95% CI: 0.630–0.797), respectiv ely.
These results indicated that uric acid might be a potential
biomarkerofCHDinAF.
Analysis of Uric Acid Levels in Maternal
Serum of CHD Cases
Uric acid can be used as a biomarker for the detection of CHD
in AF. However, due to the invasive mode of AF collection, it
is not suitable as a marker in the general population. Therefor e,
we measured the levels of uric acid in maternal serum in CHD
cases during the second trimester. Twenty-nine maternal se rum
samples of CHD cases and 58 control samples matched for

DISCUSSION
The changes in speciﬁc metabolites in AF are closely related t o
fetalmalformations( 28).Inthisstudy,weselectedsamplesinthe
second trimester of pregnancy for metabolomics study, becau se,
at this time, fetal organogenesis period almost ended and the
composition was relatively simple, mainly fetal urine, makin g iteasierforustoseekfordiﬀerentialmetabolites,whileuntarg eted
metabolomics method made it possible. Thus, in this study we
selected AF samples to analyze metabolites related to fetal CHD
by GC-TOF-MS based metabolomics method. Published studies
usedNMRtoexploreAFmetabolism( 16,17).
The OPLS-DA model showed that there was a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in metabolic proﬁles between CHD and control cases
inAF,withobviousseparationtrend.Inunivariateanalysis ,only

elevatedinCHD.Ofrelevance,therewasnosigniﬁcantdiﬀere nce
inprolinelevelbetweencontrolsandCHDbeforetheadjustment
for GA, maternal age, and fetal gender, and the diﬀerence
appeared only after adjusting for these factors. Conversely, the
higher level of uric acid CHD was apparent before and after
the adjustment. In addition, we believe that maternal age an d
fetal gender have no signiﬁcant eﬀect on proline and uric acid
levels. This conviction is based on the fact that regardless of
the diﬀerence between the two groups, the changes in proline
and uric acid levels were consistent across the discovery and
validationsets.
Graca et al. ( 16,17) did not ﬁnd changes in proline
and uric acid levels in AF when using MRI to detect fetal
malformations, including CHD. However, the changes in uric

acid were consistent with the urine biomarker reported by Xie
et al. (19), as shown in Table1. Our results using AF were not
consistentwiththoseobtainedusingthematernalserumine arly
pregnancy reported by Bahado-Singh et al. ( 18) and our own
results in maternal serum. These discrepancies may be caused
by the selected sample type because our study of the serum of
pregnant women in the second trimester also did not detect a
signiﬁcant change in uric acid in the CHD cases. Although uri c
acidinAFcanbeusedasamarkerforCHD,uricacidinmaternal
serum is not a suitable marker for this condition. A previous
studybyKeetal.( 29)showedthatCHDpregnancieshadahigher
probability of hyperuricemia than non-CHD pregnancies, and
uricacidplayedanimportantroleintheearlydevelopmentofthe
heart.Theyconcludedthaturicacidmightbeanovelmarkerf or
CHD.However,ourresultsdocumentedthatserumlevelsofur ic
acid in pregnant women with CHDs were all within the normal
range( <430µmol/L),whileinthestudyofKeetal.( 29),among
306 CHD pregnancies, only 43 (14.05%) had hyperuricemia.
Therefore, we considered that uric acid in the blood is not a
biomarkerforCHD.
To evaluate the performance of proline and uric acid in
detecting CHD, we performed the ROC curve analysis. The
results showed that uric acid had moderate predictive power,
while the AUC value for the ability of proline to detect CHD
was low (AUC <0.6). Based on AUC, the performance of the
combination of uric acid and proline in detecting CHD did not
exceed that of uric acid alone; therefore, the level of uric a cid in
AF may be a potential marker for CHD. Uric acid was closely
related to CHD, and the OR values in the discovery set and the
validation set were 7.69 (95% CI: 1.18–50.13) and 3.24 (95% C I:
1.62–6.48), respectively. While the collection of AF is inva sive
and not suitable for widespread use, the uric acid test in the
AF can be employed as an additional test after amniocentesis,
assistinginprenataltestingforCHD.
Uric acid may play an important role in the pathological
process of CHD. Uric acid is the end product of purine
metabolism in humans ( 30). Ke et al. ( 29) reported that uric
acid can enhance cardiac diﬀerentiation of human pluripotent
stem cells (PSCs) at day 0–2 through SNAI pathway-mediated
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a lengthened
G0/G1 phase, indicating the importance of uric acid in
heart development. Uric acid is considered a risk factor for
cardiovasculardisease,andelevatedserumuricacidisass ociated
with increased risk of incident heart failure ( 30,31). Our results
also showed that the level of uric acid in CHD was signiﬁcantl y
increased in AF. It can be seen that, on the one hand, uric acid
promotes the development of the heart, and on the other hand,
highlevelsofuricacidareharmfultotheheart.Itispossible that

Our study ﬁrst identiﬁed uric acid as an eﬀective biomarker
forCHDinAFandthiswillprovidemoreopportunitytoexplorethe pathogenesis of CHD and to develop detective biomarkers
of CHD. However, Our study has some limitations. Firstly,fr om
the perspective of sample selection, we chose AF sample, which
is invasive and not suitable for routine clinical use. However ,
the composition of AF is relatively simple compared with blood
and urine, and it is easy to explore the markers of CHD. As a
basic study, it lays the foundation for our future study on bl ood
metabolomics of pregnant women. What’s more, heterogeneity
may be caused by various types of CHD. This requires us to
explore the diﬀerences between diﬀerent CHDs in the next step.
Given that the concentration of uric acid is increased in CHD ,
we believe that uric acid may be involved in the pathogenesis
of CHD. We will explore this possibility and its underlying
mechanisminfuturestudies.

Abstract
Background: Prolonged hospital length of stay after congenital heart surgery is a significant cost 
burden and associated with post-operative morbidity. Our goal was to evaluate the association 
between pre- and post-operative biomarker levels and in-hospital length of stay for children after 
congenital heart surgery.
Methods: We enrolled patients <18 years of age who underwent at least 1 congenital heart 
operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2010–2014. Blood samples were collected before the 
index operation and at the end of the bypass. ST2 and NT-proBNP measurements were evaluated 
as log-transformed, median and tercile cutpoints. We evaluated the association between pre- and 
postoperative NT-proBNP and ST2 measurements with in-hospital postoperative length of stay 
using multivariate logistic regression. We adjusted for covariates used in the Society of Thoracic 
Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Risk Model.
Results: In our cohort, 45% of our patients had an in-hospital postoperative length of stay longer 
than the median. Before adjustment, preoperative NT-proBNP above the population median and 
the highest tercile exhibited a significantly longer in-hospital length of stay. After adjustment for 
covariates in the risk model, pre- and post-operative ST2 and NT-proBNP demonstrated a 
significantly longer length of stay.

outcomes.
Keywords
pediatric congenital heart disease; biomarkers; prediction; outcomes; postoperative care
Approximately one-quarter of the 40,000 children born with congenital heart disease (CHD) 
annually in the United States require intervention in their first year of life1. In adults with 
CHD, a prolonged length of stay is associated with a more complex congenital heart repair2. 
At hospitals which performed <10 pediatric congenital heart operations annually, there is 
significantly longer length of stay than those who performed >10 annually3. In the United 
States, it costs an average of $79,011 for these postoperative stays, and CHD has the highest 
total cost of birth defect categories evaluated by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention4. Prolonged postoperative hospital stay can place significant financial pressure on 
a household and the health care system5. Estimating risk factors associated with prolonged 
in-hospital length of stay is critical to tailoring interventions for children to improve their 
quality of care and for reducing the cost of surgery6. Longer in-hospital stays after 
operations can be attributed to reasons such as complications during surgery, additional time 
needed for screening/surveillance, social/family considerations, or an increased risk of 
morbidity or mortality after discharge7.
Recent research suggests that cardiac biomarkers play a role in the prediction of adverse 
outcomes of congenital heart operations8. The FDA approved cardiac biomarkers N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and ST2 are widely recognized as having 
prognostic utility in adult heart failure evaluation, yet the clinical application in pediatric 
cardiac surgery is not well understood. Preliminary evidence suggests that cardiac 
biomarkers can help identify pediatric patients at high risk for longer postoperative length of 
stay following congenital heart surgery.
ST2 is a member of the Interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor family and plays a significant role in 
the inflammatory and autoimmune responses that take place within the body9,10. 
Specifically, in the heart, ST2 expression is induced in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts 
by biomechanical strain injury or angiotensin. Therefore, elevated levels of ST2 present as a 
response to myocardial stress, such as myocardial ischemia, neurohormonal activation or 
mechanical overload. NT-proBNP is a biomarker released from the myocytes as a reaction to 
cardiac chamber dilation, wall stress, or pressure overload11. In adults, NT-proBNP is a 
significant marker of hemodynamic and functional characteristics of the patients, as well as 
predicting longer ICU length of stay (LOS), in-hospital LOS and increased ventilation 
time12.
The relative utility of ST2 and NT-proBNP in predicting prolonged length of stay after 
pediatric congenital heart surgery has not been investigated. We sought to evaluate the novel 
clinical utility of biomarkers to identify children with an increased risk of a longer in-
hospital stay after pediatric congenital heart surgery.Green et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Patients and Methods
Pediatric Cohort
We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study of 244 consecutive 
patients who underwent at least one congenital cardiac operation, with cardiopulmonary 
bypass, at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center from 2010 to 2014. Patient, procedural, and 
outcome data was collected. The cohort was limited to patients with biomarker information 
collected in association with the initial cardiac operation for each admission (index 
operation; N = 174). We excluded patients with unknown prematurity status, patients 
weighing 2.5 kg or less, and patients age 18 years or older. We restricted our cohort to 
patients who had at least one preoperative and one postoperative biomarker measurement 
(N=162)8. The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College and 
Johns Hopkins University (Institutional Review Board) approved this study for the 
prospective cohort with parental consent.
Sample Collection
Perioperative blood samples (heparinized plasma) were collected immediately prior to skin 
incision and at the end of bypass. Samples were processed and stored at −80°C until 
assayed. Biomarkers were measured by ELISA using a custom printed multiplex assay 
(Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) using commercial antibodies and calibrators 
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described13,14.
Main Outcome
The outcome variable was postoperative in-hospital length of stay. This stay was measured 
in days and started the day after the index operation occurred. We elected to evaluate the 
outcome by dichotomizing length of stay by the median (7 days) for the entire cohort, 
regardless of surgical severity.
Data Collected from the Index Operation
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the 
preoperative and postoperative continuous, log continuous, median, and tercile cut-points. 
These analyses were adjusted based on covariates in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 
Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSD) Mortality Risk Model6. Risk factors in the 
model include age at surgery (in days) at surgery, weight (by kilograms), any prior 
cardiothoracic operation (yes/no), any non-cardiac congenital anatomic abnormality (yes/
no), any chromosomal abnormality or syndrome (yes/no), presence of any clinical 
preoperative risk factors, operationalized as 5 different count variables listed on the footer of 
Table 1. Given the limited number of outcome events, we aggregated all preoperative risk 
factors and dichotomized based on the presence of none or ≥ 1.
Statistical Analysis
Patient, clinical and procedural characteristics were compared by in-hospital length of stay 
using descriptive statistics. Differences in risk factors were compared using Pearson’s chi-
square tests; continuous variables were compared with two-sample t-tests. Patients were Green et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript arranged by preoperative and postoperative biomarker levels above and below the population 
median. Similarly, patients were equally distributed into equal sized terciles for each of the 
biomarkers. Indicator variables were created for each of the terciles and median values.
Results
As shown in Table 1, among those in our cohort, the median age was 281 days (range 2 
days-17 years) and the median weight was 8.4kg (range 2.7kg to 106kg). There was a slight 
male predominance within our cohort (59.9% to 40.1%). The minority of our cohort had at 
least one preoperative risk factor (N=26), while the majority of our cohort had a prior 
cardiovascular operation (N=129). The median length of stay after congenital heart surgery 
was 7 days with a range of 3–148 days.
Preoperative and Postoperative ST2 and In-hospital Length of Stay
Before adjustment, preoperative ST2 values above the median and the highest tercile were 
significantly associated with longer in-hospital length of stay after heart surgery (OR: 4.56; 
95% CI: 2.34–8.87; OR: 5.17; 95% CI: 2.28–11.73, respectively). After adjustment, ST2 
median and tercile values demonstrated a significant relationship with above average length 
of stay (OR: 3.60; 95% CI: 1.67–7.74; OR: 3.38; 1.32–8.67 (Table 2).
Before adjustment, postoperative ST2 values above the median and the highest tercile were 
significantly associated with longer in-hospital length of stay after heart surgery (OR: 3.64; 
95% CI: 1.89–6.98; OR: 5.64; 95% CI: 2.47–12.88, respectively). After adjustment, there 
was a lower but still significant risk of an above average length of stay for the median and 
highest tercile (OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.21–5.33; OR: 3.39; 95% CI: 1.31–8.79) (Table 2).
Preoperative and Postoperative NT-Probnp and In-hospital Length of Stay
Before adjustment, preoperative NT-proBNP values above the median and the highest tercile 
were significantly associated with longer in-hospital length of stay after heart surgery (OR: 
2.63; 95% CI: 1.39–4.97; OR: 4.35; 95% CI: 2.47–12.88, respectively). After adjustment, 
NT-proBNP median and tercile values demonstrated a significant relationship with above 
average length of stay (OR:1.67; 95% CI: 0.78–3.57; OR: 3.87; 95% CI:1.48–10.10) (Table 
2).
Before adjustment, postoperative NT-proBNP values above the median and the highest 
tercile were significantly associated with above average length of stay after heart surgery 
(OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.26–4.46; OR: 4.35; 95% CI: 1.94–9.75, respectively). After 
adjustment, there was significant odds of above average stay for the highest pre and 
postoperative tercile (OR: 3.87; 95% CI: 1.48 – 10.10, OR: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.17–7.17) (Table 
2).
Comment
In pre-and postoperative ST2 and NT-proBNP, we found a significant association with 
increased in-hospital length of stay following congenital heart surgery (Figure 1). This 
association was determined based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis for the Green et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript median and third tercile cutpoints. In postoperative NT-proBNP after adjustment, there was 
significant odds of longer length of stay for the highest tercile (OR: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.17–
7.17) (Table 2). For pre and postoperative ST2, we found a 3.4-times higher odds of a longer 
in-hospital length of stay (Table 2).
Biomarkers are routinely collected substances that signal a process taking place within an 
individual15. Biomarkers have been used in the past to evaluate 30-day readmission or 
mortality results after pediatric congenital heart surgery16. While ST2 and NT-proBNP have 
been demonstrated to have prognostic utility in the adult population, the clinical application 
in pediatric cardiac care is novel.
We have previously analyzed the utility of cardiac biomarkers in predicting a variety of 
postoperative outcomes following congenital heart surgery. We found that NT-proBNP was 
not associated with 365-day unplanned readmission or death, but pre- and postoperative ST2 
was significantly associated with 365-day unplanned readmission or death8. Additionally, 
we found that pre and post-operative ST2 was associated with unplanned 30-day 
readmission or death, while NT-proBNP was not useful in predicting 30-day readmission or 
death17. This evaluation of the utility of length of stay provides new insight to our team’s 
guidance on the use of biomarkers, and especially the utility of ST2, using an outcome 
variable with limited literature surrounding it.
Elevated postoperative NT-proBNP levels have shown to be associated with a longer hospital 
stay after superior cavopulmonary connection surgery18. Changes in body composition 
occur in children with CHD, and NT-proBNP has been observed as an indicator of 
myocardial stress for children who do not receive proper nutrition19 Unlike NT-proBNP, 
ST2 is not cardiac specific, and has been shown in a noncardiac intensive care unit (ICU) 
population that high ST2 levels, were associated with a longer ICU and hospital stay20. 
Additionally, among ICU patients, ST2 demonstrated the ability to predict 90-day 
mortality20.
Elevated biomarker levels represent the regulation of the inflammatory and autoimmune 
response in the body21,22. Specifically in the heart, ST2 is expressed in both cardiomyocytes 
and cardiac fibroblasts that induced either by biomechanical strain injury or angiotensin. 
Elevated levels of ST2 present as a response to myocardial stress, such as myocardial 
ischemia, neurohormonal activation or mechanical overload23. NT-proBNP is a cardiac 
hormone and sensitive measure of cardiac stretch and has been used in heart failure 
treatment and to predict outcomes in patients with congenital heart disease and pulmonary 
hypertension24. These elevated biomarker levels signal more cardiac damage following 
congenital heart surgery, estimating longer in-hospital length of stay.
Prolonged postoperative hospital stays are associated with complex congenital heart 
operations2. In a study of the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta hospital, 70 patients who 
were readmitted after congenital heart surgery “spent a total of 653 days in the hospital, 205 
of which were in the ICU. Total charges generated by these readmission hospital stays were 
approximately $8 million.”5 This information would assist practitioners in determining the 
appropriate timing of surgery and assess surgical alternatives. As a result, these cardiac Green et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript biomarkers can be useful tools for risk stratification and improved patient care management 
with a goal of improving postoperative outcomes.
Limitations
This study has a few limitations. First, risk adjustment was initially performed using the 
covariates from the contemporary version of the STS-CHSD mortality risk model, which is a 
method of adjusting for clinical and procedural case mix. Due to the low event rate, we were 
not able to adjust for all of the covariates included in the risk adjustment model. Specifically, 
we were not able to adjust for prematurity status or the individual preoperative risk factors 
described in the STS CHSD model (preoperative/preprocedural mechanical circulatory 
support; shock, persistent at time of operation; renal dysfunction or renal failure requiring 
dialysis; mechanical ventilation to treat cardiorespiratory failure; and preoperative 
neurological deficit). Second, a larger sample size would have improved our power to assess 
the performance of ST2 and NT-proBNP in the preoperative setting. Third, we included only 
patients for whom both pre-and post-operative samples had been collected. This approach 
may lead to sampling bias if biomarker collection was associated with congenital heart 
disease severity.
Conclusion
We found an association between elevated NT-proBNP and ST2 and an increased risk of 
longer postoperative hospital length of stay. The ability to predict postoperative adverse 
outcomes from preoperative clinical data has important implications for identifying patients 
who may benefit from earlier interventions after cardiac surgery. These biomarkers can be 
useful tools for risk stratification and improved patient care management. More research on 
the utility of cardiac biomarker levels as an indicator for potential postoperative 
complications will equip surgeons with information necessary to decrease adverse outcomes.

2014The population of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) now exceeds the 
population of children with CHD. The long-term management of these patients relies 
on sequential assessment of anatomy and physiology and integration with symptoms, 
all targeted toward decision making around intervention. The advances in technology 
have vastly improved our assessment of anatomy and function. However, while the 
assessment of chronic heart failure in acquired heart disease has been revolutionized 
by the proven utility of cardiac biomarkers, their use in adult CHD is still being assessed.
Keywords: adult congenital   heart   disease   •   biomarkers   •   heart   failure   •   heart   function
The success of pediatric cardiology and car -
diac surgery has resulted in an increasing 
population of adults with congenital heart 
disease (CHD). In all but the most simple 
lesions, interventions in childhood are rarely 
curative, necessitating lifelong follow-up 
for many. Further interventions, whether 
surgical, transcatheter or pharmacological, 
are inevitable for many patients in order to 
 preserve cardiac function.
The challenge for the team caring of these 
adults is the timing of intervention. No 
patient wishes to take medications unless 
absolutely necessary and side effects may 
impact significantly on quality of life. Prema -
ture surgical reintervention at worst exposes 
the patient to unnecessary risk, particularly 
in a time when technical advances are ever 
increasing the range of transcatheter solu -
tions. Furthermore, for many patients who 
require repeated interventions, early surgery 
may increase the total number of surgeries 
during their life. Not only does this expose 
the patient to the risk of an extra interven -
tion, but risk also increases with each surgery. 
While transcatheter intervention has lessened 
the requirement for surgery in some cases, 
procedures are still associated with significant 
risk and inappropriate treatment is unaccept -
able. Conversely, late intervention may allow permanent damage to cardiac function and a 
reduced benefit from treatment.
Sequential follow-up aims to integrate 
information gained from clinical review, 
noninvasive imaging and/or invasive hemo -
dynamic assessments in an attempt to deter -
mine the optimal timing of intervention. 
International guidelines have been agreed 
based on the available evidence helping to 
guide management. However, in contrast to 
many areas of acquired cardiology practice, 
these guidelines are based on expert consen -
sus rather than high-quality evidence from 
randomized trials.
The utility of biomarkers in acquired 
structural heart disease is well established. 
Clinically relevant biomarkers have been 
required to be clinically available, contribut -
ing new information, and that information 
aids in the management of the individual 
patient [1]. Biomarkers offer the potential for 
a novel approach to the assessment of car -
diac function in adult CHD (ACHD) either 
directly or through the consequences of a 
changing cardiac status on other organ sys -
tems. The utility of biomarkers in the assess -
ment of ACHD has yet to be realized, with 
small studies only offering a glimpse of the 
true potential to monitor disease and inform 
on the timing of interventions.Biomarkers in congenital heart disease

The ultimate biomarker, or combination of bio -
markers, in monitoring cardiac function in ACHD has 
yet to be described. The current paper summarizes the 
available evidence and gives a clear indication of the 
need for further research into this field.
Method
We searched Ovid Medline including in-process and 
other nonindexed citations from 1947 to January 2014 
week 1, and Embase from 1996 to January 2014 week 2. 
Subheadings used included ‘Biological Markers and 
Heart Defects, Congenital’ (Medline), and ‘Biologi -
cal Marker’ and ‘Congenital Heart Disease’ (Embase). 
Keyword searches were also employed for each database. 
Finally, we manually searched the reference lists of key 
review articles. We excluded papers that assessed the use 
of biomarkers exclusively in a perioperative setting, or 
that employed them for prenatal screening of CHD.
Results
Natriuretic peptides
Description
Three natriuretic peptides have been identified, 
namely, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natri -
uretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide 
(CNP). ANP and BNP are released from cardiac 
myocytes in both the atria and ventricles in response 
to shear stress due to conditions causing pressure or 
volume loading of the cardiac chambers, and both have 
been studied with respect to CHD. In each case, a pro -
peptide is cleaved to the biologically active peptide and 
also an inactive amino or ‘N’-terminal peptide frag -
ment. Thus, potentially four different natriuretic pep -
tides can be measured: the biologically active ANP and 
BNP, and the inactive NT-proANP and NT-proBNP 
[2]. The N-terminal peptides have a longer half life 
in vivo  and therefore give a potentially more accurate 
indication of cardiac wall stress [3].
CNP is considered as a neuropeptide that is primar -
ily distributed in the CNS. It is also produced in the 
kidney and can be measured in the urine. There is early 
interest in the clinical utility of CNP as a biomarker 
in acute decompensated heart failure, highlighting the 
renal insult of decompensated heart failure as part of 
the cardiorenal syndrome [4].
Natriuretic peptides are elevated in CHD
Elevated mean levels of the natriuretic peptides in cohorts 
of patients with CHD are well described. Bolger and col -
leagues assessed ANP and BNP levels in 53 patients with 
a variety of CHD diagnoses and demonstrated signifi -
cantly elevated levels compared with controls [5]. This 
was confirmed in a number of larger studies assessing 
ANP, BNP and NT proBNP levels in CHD [6 –11].Other studies have assessed whether natriuretic 
 peptide levels are elevated in specific CHD diagnoses.
Patients with a volume-loaded right ventricle (RV), 
typically as exemplified by repaired tetralogy of Fal -
lot (ToF) with free pulmonary regurgitation, have 
raised BNP or NT proBNP levels [8,12–15] . This appears 
to be the case even in small cohort studies of less 
than 50 patients, and has been confirmed in a recent 
 meta-analysis of 770 patients [16].
Patients with a pressure-loaded RV also have elevated 
natriuretic peptide levels compared with healthy con -
trols. The most common model for the pressure loaded 
is the systemic RV, which is most often associated with 
congenitally corrected transposition of the great arter -
ies or atrial switch surgery for complete transposition 
of the great arteries. Three studies have demonstrated 
elevated BNP levels [6,17,18], two studies have demon -
strated elevated ANP and BNP levels [19,20], and one 
study has demonstrated elevated NT proBNP levels [21].
In cyanotic CHD, or pulmonary arterial hyperten -
sion resulting from CHD (PAH-CHD), studies have 
confirmed raised BNP and NT proBNP levels [22–25] . 
A single meta-analysis suggests that patients with 
these diagnoses are likely to have the highest BNP 
and NT proBNP levels in comparison to other forms 
of CHD [26].
In patients with a Fontan circulation, the findings are 
more ambiguous. In a large pediatric study (patient age 
range: 6–18 years) of 510 patients with both atriopul -
monary Fontan and total cavopulmonary connection 
(TCPC), the median BNP level was low at 13 pg/ml. 
However, patients with AP rather than TCPC Fon -
tan, evidence of ventricular dysfunction or who had 
developed Fontan complications such as thrombosis 
were more likely to have elevated BNP levels [27]. In a 
cohort of 66 patients with TCPC, only a third had NT 
proBNP levels above the upper limit of normal [28]. A 
subsequent study from the same center, this time of 124 
patients with AP or TCPC Fontan circulations, dem -
onstrated that elevated NT proBNP levels were more 
likely in the case of an AP Fontan [29]. In a smaller 
cohort of 50 patients with a mean age of 22.7 years, 
both ANP and BNP levels were significantly elevated 
in comparison to healthy controls [30].
A single study of a small cohort of 26 patients with 
Ebstein anomaly showed elevated BNP levels com -
pared with 19 healthy controls, although interestingly 
BNP levels did not correlate with echocardiographic 
assessment of the severity of the lesion [31].
Two studies assessing natriuretic peptide levels in 
coarctation of the aorta (CoA) were identified. One 
small study of only 19 adult patients with repaired CoA 
found that NT proBNP levels were not elevated com -
pared with controls [32]. Conversely, a larger study of  www.futuremedicine.com 967
future science groupBiomarkers in congenital heart disease    Review
74 adult patients found that levels of BNP were elevated 
compared with controls [33]. In congenital aortic ste -
nosis (AS), BNP levels were not significantly elevated 
compared with controls, even in the presence of a peak 
aortic valve gradient of up to 105 mmHg [34]. This is in 
contrast to larger studies of patients with acquired AS 
where natriuretic peptide levels are typically elevated, 
although even then it should be noted that correlation 
with markers of lesion severity is at best modest [35].
Finally, some studies have assessed natriuretic pep -
tide levels in the presence of a hemodynamically sig -
nificant atrial septal defect (ASD) or ventricular septal 
defect. As with Fontan patients levels may not always 
be elevated in comparison to age- and sex-matched 
controls, however they are much more likely to be so 
in the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension or a 
significant shunt [36–39] .
The recent paper by Eindhoven and colleagues [26] 
has elegantly demonstrated the correlation of NT 
proBNP with a range of congenital cardiac lesions in 
the adult population. As demonstrated in Figure 1 
from [26], the impact of a systemic RV or univentricu -
lar physiology are reflected in elevation of NT proBNP 
levels. However, as the authors conclude, further work 
is required to understand the prognostic implications 
of elevations in the NT proBNP level.
Correlation of natriuretic peptides with other 
markers of clinical status in ACHD
Functional status
A number of studies assessed the relationship between 
natriuretic peptide levels and New York Heart Associa -
tion (NYHA) class. Most of these demonstrated a posi -
tive correlation between ANP, BNP or NT proBNP 
levels and NYHA class [5,7,11,13,40,41]. However, it 
should be noted that in the Tutarel paper, NT proBNP 
levels were not significantly different between NYHA 
class II and III, and in one admittedly small study of 
18 patients with Eisenmenger syndrome there was no 
relationship with NYHA class at all [24,41].
NYHA class is a subjective measure of functional 
capacity, and in clinical practice it can sometimes be 
difficult to discriminate between the different classes. 
Formal exercise testing provides a more objective mea -
sure of assessment in this regard, and forms a major 
part of the follow-up of more complicated patients 
with ACHD [42,43].
The relationship between levels of the natriuretic 
peptides and parameters derived from cardiopulmo -
nary exercise testing has been assessed in a number 
of studies. The largest comprised 265 patients with a 
variety of CHD diagnoses, and showed an inverse cor -
relation between BNP level and peak oxygen uptake 
(VO2), and a positive correlation with the minute ven -tilation and carbon dioxide output (VE/VCO2) ratio 
[44]. Both of these markers have prognostic value in 
ACHD and can predict hospitalization or death [45,46].
Most of the other studies have also confirmed that 
higher natriuretic peptide levels are associated with 
lower peak oxygen uptake [5,11,41], although some 
smaller studies and those assessing natriuretic peptide 
levels in Fontan patients have not [20,30,31,40]. One study 
of 50 patients with repaired toF showed an inverse cor -
relation between NT proBNP levels and peak oxygen 
uptake, but no correlation with NT proANP levels [8].
Noninvasive imaging assessment of cardiac 
function & lesion severity
Several studies have assessed the relationship between 
natriuretic peptides and parameters assessed by echo -
cardiography and MRI.
In patients with repaired ToF, echocardiographic 
measurements of ventricular dilatation as defined by 
RV end-diastolic dimension or the RV to left ventricle 
diameter ratio correlate directly with levels of BNP and 
NT proBNP [16,47].
Formal RV ejection fraction is difficult to mea -
sure via 2D transthoracic echocardiography in CHD 
owing to the abnormal morphology of the chamber 
in certain lesions. Reduced myocardial performance 
index or AV valve annulus longitudinal velocity may 
be more reproducible ways of quantifying RV systolic 
function, and appear to correlate reasonably well with 
BNP  levels [17,48].
Where cardiac MRI is available, RV volumes and 
ejection fraction can be assessed with a high degree 
of accuracy and reproducibility. A positive correla -
tion with BNP and NT proBNP levels has been 
demonstrated in systemic RV, ASD and repaired ToF 
cohorts [14,21,49,50]. One small study of 50 patients with 
repaired ToF suggested a relationship between NT 
proBNP levels and the degree of RV fibrosis present, as 
assessed by scoring for late gadolinium enhancement 
[51]. In patients with a Fontan circulation, there was 
a weak correlation between BNP levels and systemic 
 ventricular mass [27].
Regarding valve function, higher BNP levels have 
been noted in the presence of significant tricuspid or 
pulmonary regurgitation in repaired ToF [13,52], and 
NT proBNP levels are weakly correlated with the 
degree of systemic ventricular atrioventricular regur -
gitation in patients post-TCPC [29]. In congenital AS, 
BNP levels have not been demonstrated to correlate 
with lesion severity [34].
Two small studies of patients with an unrepaired 
ASD or ventricular septal defect have shown a positive 
correlation between BNP and shunt size, as assessed by 
Qp:Qs on transthoracic echocardiography [37,53]. 968 Biomarkers Med.  (2014) 8(7)
future science groupReview    Dobson, Walker & Walker
Invasive assessment of cardiac function
The relationship between natriuretic peptides and 
data from cardiac catheterization studies is less well 
 characterized owing to the small study size.
Elevated end diastolic pressure appeared to be most 
consistently associated with elevated natriuretic pep -
tide levels in a wide range of pathologies [7,50,54,55]. One 
study of 16 repaired ToF patients employed a conduc -
tance catheter to identify early onset of RV dysfunction 
by measuring RV end-systolic pressure volume relation 
as a marker for contractile reserve. Unfortunately, BNP 
levels correlated only weakly with this [56].
Prognostic value of elevated natriuretic peptides 
in ACHD
Perhaps one of the most valuable applications of natri -
uretic peptide assays in patients with acquired heart 
failure has been that of risk stratification; identifying 
patients with a poorer prognosis.
Unfortunately this has not been well characterized 
in CHD due to relatively small cohort sizes and the 
limited length of follow-up of most of these studies.
One study of 49 adult CHD patients with a median 
follow-up of 7.9 years demonstrated that ANP and 
BNP levels were strongly predictive of mortality. A 
BNP value >78 pg/ml predicted death with 100% 
sensitivity and 76% specificity, and an ANP value of 
>146 pg/ml predicted death with a 73% sensitivity and 
95% specificity. However, almost one in five patients 
had moderate-to-severe systemic ventricular dysfunc -
tion, so this cohort may not be representative of most 
ACHD populations [57].
In a cohort of 383 patients with a variety of con -
genital cardiac diagnoses, BNP levels were predictive 
of morbidity in a multivariate model in the subgroup 
of 82 patients with a Fontan circulation, with a hazard 
ratio of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03–1.13) for every 10-pg/ml 
increase in BNP [58].
Two studies of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome 
have also shown that BNP levels are predictive of hos -
pitalization or death. The largest study of 181 patients 
with a median follow-up of 3.3 years demonstrated a 
hazard ratio for mortality of 1.68 for every 100-pg/ml 
increase in BNP [59]. A serum BNP level of >140 pg/
ml or rapid increase in BNP over time was predictive of 
hospitalization with heart failure or death in a smaller 
study of 53 patients [60].
Utility of natriuretic peptide assays in predicting 
response to a medical or surgical intervention
In acquired heart failure, serial measurements of natri -
uretic peptides can be used to assess response to ther -
apy, and in valvular heart disease there is increasing 
interest in the role of natriuretic peptides in identifying patients who would benefit from surgical intervention 
[35,61]. Once again, this has yet to be well demonstrated 
in CHD.
Medical therapy
Only three studies were identified that assess the 
response of natriuretic peptide levels to medical treat -
ment for heart failure. Each study comprised less than 
50 patients, and in all cases the affected ventricle was 
morphologically an RV. One study of Olmesartan 
in 41 repaired ToF patients with moderate-to-severe 
pulmonary regurgitation showed a small reduction 
in BNP levels after 6 months of treatment; however, 
this was not correlated to any other outcome measures 
[62]. A randomized controlled trial of 26 patients with 
a systemic RV failed to show a significant reduction 
in NT proBNP with administration of Eplerenone for 
1 year; however, as well as the small size, the mean 
RV ejection fraction at baseline was actually preserved 
at 55% [63]. Finally, the administration of Losartan in 
a randomized controlled crossover trial to 29 patients 
with a systemic RV and impaired RV ejection fraction 
at baseline (mean 42%) failed to show any significant 
reduction in NT proBNP or exercise capacity after 
15 weeks of treatment [64].
Surgical & device therapy
One of the most common interventions performed in 
adult CHD is pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) for 
the severe pulmonary regurgitation that results from 
ToF repair or congenital pulmonary stenosis treatment 
in childhood. Three studies comprising a total of 70 
patients have assessed trends in natriuretic peptides fol -
lowing PVR (60 surgical, ten percutaneous), and all 
demonstrated a significant fall in BNP or NT proBNP 
after the intervention [65–67] . Unfortunately, the stud -
ies have been too small to identify a cutoff at which 
PVR is associated with better clinical outcomes.
Natriuretic peptide levels have also been assessed in 
response to ASD device closure. In the largest study 
of 446 patients undergoing this procedure, there was 
an initial rise in ANP and BNP levels, and this only 
subsequently fell at 6 months in the younger patients 
(<20 years). The authors suggested, therefore, that 
this was an indication to perform ASD closure as 
young as possible [36]. In two smaller studies of 25 
and 20 patients, levels of BNP and NT proBNP fell 
in response to device closure [50,68]. The reason for this 
is unclear, especially as the mean age at closure in the 
Schoen paper (43 years) was higher than the median 
age at closure in the Sugiyama paper (26 years).
Unfortunately, in the limited literature regard -
ing the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy in 
repaired CHD, no studies were identified that assessed  www.futuremedicine.com 969
future science groupBiomarkers in congenital heart disease    Review
change in natriuretic peptide or other biomarker levels 
postintervention [69,70].
Utility of natriuretic peptide assessment in CHD & 
pregnancy
Two studies were identified that assessed natriuretic 
peptide measurement in pregnant patients with CHD.
One cohort of 66 patients, of whom 49 had a history 
of CHD, demonstrated that BNP levels were signifi -
cantly higher compared with healthy controls, and were 
associated with adverse maternal outcomes including 
death, arrhythmia and prosthetic valve thrombosis. A 
BNP level <100 pg/ml had a negative-predictive value 
of 100% for adverse maternal events [71].
A larger study of 209 pregnant women with CHD 
demonstrated that NT proBNP was higher at 20 and 
32 weeks compared with 70 healthy pregnant women. 
Levels fell during pregnancy, and this was attributable 
to increasing glomerular filtration rate. Higher NT 
proBNP levels (defined as being above the 95th per -
centile) at 20 weeks predicted impaired placental blood 
flow, as measured by uteroplacental Doppler flow at 
32 weeks [72]
Natriuretic peptides in pediatric patients
Two studies assessed the distribution of levels of natri -
uretic peptides in cohorts of patients with unselected 
CHD. In one study of 382 patients with CHD, median 
levels of BNP were significantly higher than a refer -
ence population of 173 apparently healthy children [10]. 
Higher levels were observed in lesions characterized by 
left ventricular volume and pressure loading compared 
with right ventricular volume loading. Patients with 
unpalliated univentricular heart had the highest mean 
levels of BNP overall, although the standard deviations 
were wide. In the other study, BNP levels were evalu -
ated in a population comprising 386 children with 
unrepaired CHD, with a mean age of 7.5 ± 5.6 years 
[9]. Levels were highest in pulmonary hypertension and 
cardiomyopathy. Higher levels of BNP were observed 
in lesions characterized by an intracardiac shunt (atrio -
ventricular septal defect, ventricular septal defect, ASD 
and PDA) compared with those that were not (val -
vular heart disease and aortic coarctation). Of note, 
the patients with univentricular heart experienced a 
decline in BNP levels following each successive stage 
of Fontan palliation.
Other biomarkers
Endothelin
A neurohormone secreted by vascular endothelium, 
endothelin, has been studied in several cohorts of 
patients with CHD. Two studies of 53 and 77 adults 
with CHD demonstrated that levels of endothelin were significantly elevated in comparison to controls 
[5,73]; however a larger study of 104 adults with CHD 
– predominantly repaired ToF – did not confirm this 
[11]. It should be noted that the mean age of patients 
in the Lemmer paper was approximately 10 years 
younger than the mean age of patients in the Bolger 
and Franklin papers, and this may explain the discrep -
ancy. Endothelin has also been studied in relation to 
specific CHD diagnoses. Levels were not elevated in 
19 patients with CoA [32]; however, they were raised 
in 50 patients with ToF and 50 patients post-Fontan 
repair [8,30].
Endothelin levels correlated with the VE/VCO2 
ratio at peak exercise in 48 Fontan patients in one 
study [74], and displayed an inverse relationship with 
peak VO2 in another [5]. However, levels did not cor -
relate significantly with any exercise- or imaging-
derived parameters in the Lemmer paper [11], and the 
authors did not identify any papers that assessed the 
prognostic significance of endothelin levels in repaired 
CHD.
Renin–angiotensin system
Activation of the renin–angiotensin system has been 
well described in left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
[3]. In CHD, the relationship is less clear. A study of 
53 patients with different CHD diagnoses and another 
study of 50 adult patients post-Fontan repair demon -
strated elevated levels of renin, angiotensin and aldo -
sterone in comparison to controls [5]. However two 
other studies, predominantly of patients with repaired 
ToF, did not replicate this [8,11].
Higher levels of aldosterone have correlated with 
increased atrial size, as assessed by echocardiography 
[5], and angiotensin II levels have correlated with sys -
temic ventricular ejection function in Fontan patients, 
as assessed by cardiac catheter [30]. Overall, however, 
neurohormal components of the renin–angiotensin 
system are not well described in relation to clinical 
parameters in CHD patients, and do not appear to 
predict adverse outcomes.
Catecholamines
Adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (nor -
epinephrine) do not appear to be elevated in patients 
with ToF [8,11]. However, noradrenaline levels have 
been demonstrated to be significantly higher than con -
trols in general cohorts of adult patients with repaired 
CHD, or with a Fontan circulation [5,30].
Correlation with clinical parameters is again sparse, 
with noradrenaline correlating with NYHA class 
in one small cohort of 70 all CHD patients [73], left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction with a pressure 
gradient of at least 36 mmHg in patients with a sys - 970 Biomarkers Med.  (2014) 8(7)
future science groupReview    Dobson, Walker & Walker
temic RV [75], and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 
in Fontan patients [30]. Adrenaline also correlated with 
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in systemic 
RV patients [75].
Noradrenaline was a predictor of a composite out -
come of various adverse cardiovascular events in 
 Fontan patients on multivariate analysis [30].
Asymmetric & symmetric dimethylarginine
Both asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and 
symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) are potent 
inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, and elevated lev -
els have been well described in non-CHD-related 
heart failure. In the CHD population, ADMA levels 
were significantly elevated in comparison to controls 
in a cohort of 306 patients [76]. ADMA levels corre -
lated inversely with peak VO2 in two studies with a 
total size of 400 patients [76,77], and appeared to pre -
dict  hospitalization in  Fontan patients in a subgroup 
 analysis [76].
SDMA correlated with reduced systemic ventricu -
lar function and QRS duration on ECG in 45 patients 
with a systemic RV following atrial switch surgery, in 
contrast to NT proBNP or ADMA [41].
Highly sensitive troponin T
Troponin T is released as a direct result of cardiac 
myocyte necrosis, and this may occur in heart failure 
in general rather than exclusively in the context of 
myocardial ischemia. Raised levels can independently 
predict adverse events in chronic heart failure in a 
 noncongenital population [3].
In patients with CHD, three small studies (all 
<50 patients) have assessed highly sensitive troponin T. 
It appears to be elevated in patients with CHD in com -
parison to controls, and in patients with a systemic RV 
it was associated with systemic ventricular dysfunction 
as assessed by echo including via parameters such as 
global longitudinal strain, which may be more accurate 
determinants of function in this population [78,79]. In a 
univariate model, raised levels predicted increased risk 
of death in systemic RV patients [25].
Serum sodium
One study of 169 patients with a Fontan circulation 
identified hyponatremia as a predictor of poor clinical 
outcomes. In the 91 adult patients, hyponatremia con -
ferred a greater than threefold risk of  hospitalization [80].
Growth differentiation factor-15
Part of the transforming growth factor- β superfam -
ily, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) has a 
role in modulating inflammatory pathways [3]. Raised 
GDF-15 levels were associated with higher NYHA class and lower peak VO2 in 317 all CHD patients [81], 
and in a group of 35 Fontan patients also correlated 
with NYHA class and reduced systemic ventricular 
 function [82].
Markers of extracellular matrix remodeling
This includes matrix metalloprotease (MMP) and pro -
collagen peptides [3]. MMP-9 levels were raised in a 
cohort of 77 CHD patients compared with controls 
[73], although when studied in 82 patients with a bicus -
pid aortic valve, they did not correlate with the degree 
of aortopathy [83].
Levels of procollagen type III and C-terminal pro -
collagen type I were also elevated compared with 
controls in three studies [51,63,84]. However, they cor -
related poorly with other clinical parameters of disease 
 severity.
Inflammatory markers
This group of biomarkers includes C-reactive protein 
(CRP), interleukin (IL) subtypes and TNF- α [3]. 
Only one of three studies assessing levels of CRP in 
CHD patients managed to demonstrate a significant 
elevation in comparison to controls [24,73,85]. Levels 
of TNF-α and IL-6 and IL-10 were more likely to be 
elevated in CHD; however, the significance of this has 
not been established [73,85].
Hemoglobin & iron profile
Routine blood tests should not be overlooked in their 
potential role as biomarkers. Anemia has been demon -
strated to be a marker of poor outcome in patients with 
ACHD. In noncyanotic ACHD patients, a low hemo -
globin (<13 g/dl in males and <12 g/dl in females) 
correlated with increased diuretic requirements and a 
threefold increase in mortality compared with non -
anemic patients [86]. The adequacy of iron stores can 
be challenging to assess, particularly in the cyanotic 
population where the hemoglobin is expected to be ele -
vated as a secondary erythrocytosis in response to the 
low-oxygen saturations. An iron profile can be instruc -
tive; however, it was recently demonstrated that an ele -
vated red cell distribution width is a useful  surrogate 
for low apoferritin levels [87].
Routine biochemistry
In the perioperative setting, the only markers demon -
strated to be highly predictive of mortality are abnor -
mal thyroid function tests, elevated creatinine and an 
elevated bilirubin [88]
Conclusion
The increasing population of adults with CHD is a 
success story reflecting the improvement in both pedi - www.futuremedicine.com 971

atric and adult care. Clinicians face new challenges 
in the management of the ACHD population, often 
with scant evidence to guide decision-making. Com -
prehensive imaging and functional assessment form 
the foundation of the current approach to follow-up. 
However, the potential for biomarkers to augment our 
understanding of a changing cardiac function offers 
a new approach assisting in the determination of the 
timing and nature of investigation and intervention in 
ACHD.
Current guidelines do not mention the role for bio -
markers despite evidence of their utility in ACHD 
management. Routine biochemistry and hematology 
assessment are highly instructive, and optimization of 
thyroid function, liver function and hematology can 
improve perioperative outcomes. For other biomarkers, 
such as BNP, there is clear evidence that they reflect 
cardiac function in ACHD, although the relation -
ship with a changing cardiac status is incompletely 
 understood.
It is unlikely that a single biomarker will provide 
all the answers and a biomarker profile may be a more 
realistic approach. However, the determination of 
the optimal biomarker profile for the surveillance of 
patients with ACHD is only the first step. It is just as 
likely that the interaction with the profile will change 
between different conditions and understanding the 
complex interplay will be as important.
Nevertheless, the benefits from such an approach are 
unquestionable. A biomarker profile that could inform 
on the optimal timing of complex investigations that 
are themselves expensive and resource limited would 
streamline follow-up enormously. Even more impor -
tantly, if such a profile could help inform on the timing of intervention, a major step forward in the manage -
ment of patients with ACHD could be achieved.
Future perspective
The next 5–10 years will hopefully see collaborative 
work to describe the biomarkers with greatest clinical 
utility in the ACHD population. This will also focus 
on identifying ‘normal’ ranges for these biomark -
ers in specific physiological or anatomical states; for 
example, univentricular hearts with Fontan physiol -
ogy, ToF post-repair or cyanotic states. Finally, with 
collaboration among the ACHD clinicians, adequate 
patient groups should be achievable to establish the 
trends in biomarker profile associated with clinical 
deterioration and the trigger points that could prompt 
more extensive or invasive assessment or intervention 
( pharmacological, surgical or catheter based).
A strategy of timed investigation based on biomarker 
thresholds may become important in optimizing the 
use of expensive assessments resources such as cardiac 
MRI in an expanding population of patients with 
ACHD. This work, and focused collaboration, will be 
essential in fulfilling the potential power of  biomarkers 
in this fascinating population.

Pulmonary hypertension
Endothelial dysfunctionBrain natriuretic peptideAsymmetric dimethylarginineVascular endothelial growth factorBackground: The development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with congenital heart dis-
ease (CHD) is multifactorial with a number of biomarkers serving as mediators of neurohormonal activation
[B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its N-terminal-pro-fragment (NT-proBNP)], endothelial dysfunction[asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)] and cellular proliferation [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)].
Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature for trials studying the role of these biomarkers in the clinical
evaluation, prognosis and management of patients with PAH related to CHD (CHD –PAH).
Results: Twenty-six studies were included in the systematic review, involving a total of 1113 patients with CHD –
PAH. These patients had higher BNP, NT-proBNP and ADMA levels and higher VEGF expression when compared
with healthy controls. Baseline and serial values of plasma levels of natriuretic peptides were shown to be
signiﬁcant predictors of survival. ADMA concentration was elevated in patients with CHD –PAH when compared
with patients with simple CHD without PAH, whereas VEGF expression was particularly high in patients with
CHD and persistent PAH after corrective surgery of the underlying heart disease.
Conclusion: Right heart dysfunction, endothelial in ﬂammation and proliferation are mirrored by plasma levels of
the corresponding biomarkers among patients with CHD –PAH. There is early evidence to suggest that natriuretic
peptides, in particular, may be a simple and effective tool for determining prognosis and timing for therapeutic
interventions in patients with CHD –PAH.

1. Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a relatively common
complication in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), affecting
both disease progression and prognosis. Increased proliferation and
migration of pulmonary vascular smooth cells are considered to be the
pathophysiological keystones in all forms of PAH [1]. Additionally,
neurohormonal activation and endothelial dysfunction are also impor-
tant pathogenic features in PAH associated with CHD (CHD –PAH) [2].
To this extent, some biomarkers have been identi ﬁed to play an impor-
tant role in the pathophysiology of CHD –PAH, serving as mediators
of neurohormonal activation [B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its
N-terminal-pro-fragment (NT-proBNP)], endothelial dysfunction[asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)], and cell proliferation [vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)].
Numerous biomarkers have been shown to carry prognostic signi ﬁ-
cance in idiopathic PAH and to correlate with other predictors of out-
come. As CHD –PAH differs signi ﬁcantly to other types of PAH in terms
of cardiac physiology and prognosis, it is indeed a worthwhile endeavor
reviewing the evidence related to this expanding group of patients. In
the present systematic review, we sought to evaluate the literature on
the role of BNP/NT-proBNP, ADMA, and VEGF in the diagnosis, clinical
management and prognosis of patients with CHD –PAH.
2. Methods
2.1. Search strategy
Eligible studies were identi ﬁed through literature search in the electronic databases
MEDLINE and EMBASE with the use of various combinations of MeSH and non-MeSHterms, with focus on pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease.The following Medical Subject Headings and text key words were used: “cardiac or
heart defects, congenital, ”“heart defects, congenital ”and“pulmonary hypertension, arte-
rial”and “natriuretic peptide, brain ”and/or “pro-brain natriuretic peptide ”and/or
“dimethylarginine, asymmetric ”and/or “endothelial growth factor, vascular. ”TheInternational Journal of Cardiology xxx (2014) xxx –xxx

genital heart disease. A</mTitle..., Int J Cardiol (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.04.156 reference sections of all relevant studies were screened with the same inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria, for the identi ﬁcation of potentially relevant studies missed by the initial
search strategy. Data from inception through 22nd of January 2014 were included.
2.2. Eligibility of studies
Studies of any design, concerning human subjects and published in English language,
that reported BNP, NT-proBNP, ADMA and VEGF levels in patients with CHD –PAH were
considered eligible for the systematic review. Articles presenting the biomarkers levelsfor a group of PAH diagnoses were excluded. Review studies, letters to the editors, casereports, studies published in language other than English as well as studies in whichdata duplication could not have been ruled out were excluded from the systematic review.
2.3. Data extraction
Two independently working reviewers (S.A.M. and G.G.) assessed the eligibility of all
potentially relevant articles and a standardized form was used for the data extraction. Datawere extracted on type of study general characteristics (author, journal, year of publica-
tion, study design), characteristics of study group and control group when reported
(type of CHD, age, sex, levels of biomarkers), methodology (biomarkers measurementmethod) and outcomes (potential correlation between biomarkers and cardiac functionparameters, exercise capacity, adverse events and prognosis). When data was presentedin subgroups, the following formula was used for the calculation of the common standard
deviation: SD
2¼n1−1 ðÞ /C3 SD12þn2−1 ðÞ /C3 SD22þm12þm22−2/C3m1/C3m2 ðÞn1/C3n2
n1þn2
n1þn2−1, where nis the sample size,
mthe mean and SD the standard deviation. When n ecessary, data was extracted by graphics
by two independent reviewers. When necessary, a conversion to the expressed biomarkerconcentrations units was performed. The conversion factor for BNP is 1 pg/ml =
0.289 pmol/l, and for NT-proBNP it is 1 pg/ml = 0.118 pmol/l. Discrepancies were solved
by an investigator, not involved in the initial procedure (H.K.).
3. Results
Fig. 1 presents the ﬂow of studies identi ﬁed for the systematic re-
view and the number of studies excluded in each stage of the collection.
The heterogeneity in patient population (age, CHD type and severity)
and presentation of the results prevented us from conducting a formal
meta-analysis.3.1. BNP and NT-proBNP
BNP and NT-proBNP levels were studied in a total of 17 studies in-
volving 965 patients with various forms of CHD complicated with PAH
(Table 1 ). The studied population consisted mainly of adults, with the
exception of 3 studies comprising children and adolescents [3–5]. The
mean/median patient age ranged from 4 months to 53 years. Thestudy populations covered a wide ﬁeld of CHD, ranging from simple
lesions such as atrial and ventricular septal defects and patent ductus
arteriosus, to more complex cardiac anatomy such as single ventricle,
transposition complexes, pulmonary atresia, or anomalous pulmonary
venous connections, complicated with PAH. No direct association
between cardiac defect complexity and BNP levels was reported [6],
although Williams et al. found a trend towards lower BNP plasma
concentrations in patients with PAH associated with complex cardiac
anatomy compared with patients with simpler lesions [7]. There were
no statistically signi ﬁcant differences in BNP plasma levels between pa-
tients with PAH with repaired CHD and those with PAH and unrepaired
or partially repaired CHD [8], as well as between CHD –PAH and other
forms of group 1 PAH [9]. In the 3 studies where a sex- and age-
matched control group was employed, BNP levels were signi ﬁcantly
higher in CHD –PAH patients when compared with controls (mean/
median values of BNP ranging from 80.0 to 299.3 pg/ml and from 12.0
to 22.7 pg/ml respectively, Fig. 2 )[4,10,11] . Similar results were obtain-
ed in a study comparing NT-proBNP levels in children and adolescents
with CHD –PAH versus normal controls (322.0 ± 135.6 and 67.8 ±
4.2 pg/ml respectively, pb0.001) [3].N or e l a t i o nb e t w e e na g ea n d
BNP was seen in adults; in contrast, a signi ﬁcant negative correlation be-
tween BNP and age ( r=−0.51, p= 0.01) was observed in children [5].
No difference in NT-proBNP levels was observed among pediatric CHD –
PAH patients with or without Down syndrome [3,12] . In addition, pa-
tients with Eisenmenger syndrome and in situ thrombus formation in
the pulmonary artery had higher BNP levels compared with patients
without pulmonary artery thrombosis [13].
A range of correlations between BNP and hemodynamic data were
reﬂected in 2 studies. Plasma BNP from the pulmonary artery correlated
with mean pulmonary artery pressure ( r=0 . 7 3 , p
b0.001), while
venous plasma BNP correlated with mean pulmonary artery pres-
sure ( r= 0.63, pb0.001) and with pulmonary vascular resistance
(r=0.48, pb0.01) in adults with PAH and an atrial septal defect
[11]. In contrast, venous plasma BNP levels showed a negative corre-
lation with pulmonary vascular resistance ( r=−0.56, p=0 . 0 0 4 )
in pediatric patients with PAH with a ventricular septal defect [5].
Of note, patients with Eisenmenger physiology had the lowest BNP
values, while a positive correlation was found between BNP and the
ratio of pulmonary to systemic ﬂow (Qp/Qs, r= 0.59, p= 0.003) [5].
Plasma levels of BNP correlated to endothelial progenitor cells
(r=−0.4, pb0.05) and cGMP levels ( r=0 . 7 4 , pb0.001)
[14], while NT-proBNP correlated with p rothrombotic markers, such as
von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag, r= 0.74, p= 0.004) and
markers of systemic in ﬂammation, such as C-reactive protein ( r=0 . 6 1 ,
pb0.05) [3]. NT-proBNP concentration was elevated in CHD –PAH
patients with elevated high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT N0.014 μg/l)
when compared with patients with normal hsTnT levels (median NT-
proBNP levels were 1147 and 326 pg/dl respectively, pb0.01) [15].T h e
association of natriuretic peptides with exercise capacity was explored
in two studies [6,16] ; only one of these showed a negative linear
correlation between NT-proBNP level and 6-minute walking test distance
in Eisenmenger patients ( r=−0.5,pb0.01) [16].
BNP was a signi ﬁcant predictor of survival in 3 studies with longitu-
dinal data from cohorts of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome [6,8,
17]. Results from the REVEAL registry indicated that BNP plasma levels
b50 pg/ml were signi ﬁcantly associated with improved 4-year survival
in 353 patients with CHD –PAH (hazard ratio 0.28, 95% con ﬁdence inter-
val 0.11 to 0.69, p=0 . 0 0 6 ) [8]. Diller et al. showed that the risk of death
rises with increasing BNP concentrations with levels above 104.2 pg/ml

Eisenmenger patients and to a 7.8-fold increase in a subgroup of 56 pa-
tients with Down syndrome [6]. Baseline BNP levels above 140 pg/ml
had a relative risk of 4.62 for death or heart-related hospitalization in
a smaller cohort of 53 patients with the Eisenmenger syndrome [17].
Additionally, serial changes in BNP concentrations were related to mor-
tality and/or hospitalization [6,17] . NT-proBNP was also a determinant
of mortality in a smaller cohort of 31 adult patients with CHD –PAH
[15]. PAH targeting therapies resulted in a signi ﬁcant reduction in
BNP/NT-proBNP both in adults [6,12,16,18] and children [4].
3.2. ADMA
The potential role of ADMA in patients with PAH-CHD was examined
in 4 studies including children and adults [14,19 –21]. A total of 83 pa-
tients with a mean/median age ranging from 6.1 months to 37 years
were studied ( Table 2 ). ADMA levels were signi ﬁcantly higher in CHD –
PAH patients when compared with age- and sex-matched controls
(mean/median values ranging from 0.55 to 23.1 μmol/l and from 0.21
to 17.1 μmol/l respectively) [14,19,20] . Three studies compared ADMA
levels in CHD patients with or without PAH [19–21].I n2o ft h e s es t u d i e s ,
CHD–PAH patients had higher ADMA values compared with patients
with left-to-right shunt lesions and normal pulmonary vascular resis-
tance (mean/median values ranging from 0.55 to 18.8 μmol/l and from
0.30 to 8.6 μmol/l respectively) [20,21] . Cyanotic CHD –PAH patients
had higher ADMA plasma levels [19], while no signi ﬁcant difference
was seen between patients with CHD –PAH and those with idiopathic
PAH ( Fig. 2 )[14]. Finally, patients with CHD –PAH and Down syndrome
had higher ADMA levels when compared with CHD –PAH patients with-
out Down syndrome (1.23 and 0.82 μmol/l respectively, pb0.05) [14].
A negative correlation was observed between plasma ADMA levels
and endothelial progenitor cell numbers [14].I nc o n t r a s tt oB N P ,n oc o r -
relation between ADMA serum concentration and hemodynamic or
echocardiographic parameters was noted [19].
3.3. VEGF
The VEGF activity and concentration were studied in 5 articles com-
prising a total of 106 patients with CHD –PAH, with a mean/median age
ranging from 9 to 37 years [14,22 –25]. VEGF expression was increased
in patients when compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls
(VEGF expression mean/median ranging from 2.7 to 2.9 and from 0.5 to
1.3 respectively) in 2 studies [23,24] , while VEGF plasma concentration
was either similar [22,25] or decreased [14]when compared with con-
trols ( Table 3 ) or to patients with idiopathic PAH [14]. VEGF expression,
as determined through immunolocalization on arterial vascular endo-
thelial cells, was higher in patients with persistent CHD –PAH when
compared with CHD patients with PAH that reversed after surgicalcorrection of the congenital heart defect (VEGF mean/median ranging
from 2.7 to 2.9 and from 0.5 to 1.3 respectively, pb0.05) ( Fig. 2 )[23,
24]. In contrast, plasma VEGF concentration did not differ between pa-
tients with reversed PAH after surgical correction of the heart defect,
compared with patients with persisting PAH following surgery [22].
PAH speci ﬁc therapy (prostacyclin or/and endothelin receptor antago-
nists) and therapies other than targeted PAH drugs (anticoagulation, cal-
cium channel blockers) did not affect plasma VEGF concentrations [25].
VEGF expression correlated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase
only in patients with CHD –PAH which did not reverse after surgical cor-
rection of the heart lesion ( r=0 . 9 6 , pb0.001) [24]. No correlation be-
tween plasma VEGF and hemodynamic variables or functional capacity
was observed [22,25] .
4. Discussion
We report herewith correlations between blood biomarkers and
right heart dysfunction, endothelial in ﬂammation and cellular prolifer-
ation in patients with CHD –PAH following systematic review of the
literature.
4.1. BNP and NT-proBNP
The cardiac hormone BNP, either the whole molecule or its intact
N-terminal-pro-fragment (NT-proBNP), is a recognized prognostic
marker of right heart failure and death in PAH, as well as in various
types of repaired and unrepaired CHD [26–30]. Plasma BNP was elevat-
ed both in adult and pediatric patients with CHD –PAH; despite the over-
all increase, however, a wide range of BNP values was observed
between studies. This observation can be attributed to a variety of dif-
ferent confounding factors affecting BNP concentrations, such as age
and sex, NYHA functional class, degree of cyanosis and the wide hetero-
geneity of CHD diagnostic subgroups. The higher levels of BNP in
Eisenmenger patients with in situ pulmonary arterial thrombosis
suggest a possible predisposition of thrombus formation in patients
with biventricular systolic dysfunction [13].
The association between plasma BNP and hemodynamics re ﬂects
the degree of increased right ventricular wall stress and subsequent de-
terioration in right ventricular function caused by pulmonary vascular
disease [31,32] . Right ventricular volume overload maybe a stronger
trigger of BNP production than chronic pressure overload, as stable pa-
tients with the Eisenmenger complex had lower BNP values. It is often
the case in CHD –PAH, however, that volume and pressure overload co-
exist, such as in patients with decompensated Eisenmenger syndrome,
which are usually not included in studies. The presence of con ﬂicting
data concerning the relationship of B-type natriuretic peptides and
functional capacity may re ﬂect the limitations of NYHA classi ﬁcation
and of 6-minute walking test, which in turn relate to extracardiacTable 2
ADMA plasma concentrations.

genital heart disease. A</mTitle..., Int J Cardiol (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.04.156 factors (oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, desaturation during
exercise, skeletal abnormalities, etc) [33]. Plasma BNP concentrations
correlated with endothelial progenitor cells and cGMP, while NT-
proBNP with vWF:Ag and CRP, re ﬂecting the role of vascular endothelial
dysfunction and in ﬂammation in the pathophysiology of PAH and myo-
cardial dysfunction in CHD.
BNP concentration and its serial changes seemed to predict survival
and/or hospitalization in patients with Eisenmenger physiology, with
values over 104 pg/ml being associated with an increased risk of
death [6,17] and values b50 pg/ml with better survival [8]. In addition,
advanced PAH speci ﬁc therapies resulted in a decrease of plasma BNP
levels, possibly re ﬂecting a positive cardiac effect on right heart
decompensation.
4.2. ADMA
ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and is con-
sidered a potential mediator of endothelial dysfunction in vessel disease
of the pulmonary circulation [34]. ADMA concentrations showed a wide
range of values, possibly attributed to different confounding parame-
ters, such as the severity of the underlying heart or renal disease, the
effect of PAH targeting speci ﬁc therapy, the wide heterogeneity in
CHD diagnostic subgroups and the degree of hypoxemia. The latter
may explain the higher ADMA levels in cyanotic CHD –PAH patients,
compared with acyanotic. ADMA concentrations were elevated in
CHD–PAH patients compared with age- and sex-matched controls,
while no difference was observed between idiopathic PAH and CHD –
PAH, fact that may re ﬂect their common pathophysiological basis in
terms of endothelial dysfunction. The elevated ADMA levels in
Eisenmenger patients with Down syndrome re ﬂect the extensive
abnormalities of the immune system in these patients, which may in
part be responsible for different rates of disease progression and overall
survival.
4.3. VEGF
VEGF is a potent cell mitogen serving as index of endothelial damage
and dysfunction [35]. VEGF histological expression in small pulmonary
vessels was increased in CHD –PAH, indicating the underlying intimal
proliferation and neoangiogenesis. In addition, vascular expression of
VEGF, as accessed immunohistochemically, was higher in patients
with severe pulmonary vascular disease persisting after corrective sur-
gery [23,24] . It is known that VEGF expression is elevated in arterial
cells of the characteristic lesions of advanced pulmonary plexogenic
arteriopathy, suggesting a possible role of proapoptotic factors in the
development of the irreversible pulmonary vascular changes [36].O n
the other hand, VEGF plasma concentration was either similar or
decreased in CHD –PAH patients compared with controls. Given that
VEGF can be stored in platelets, its plasma levels may be under-estimated. Additionally, VEGF plasma levels and its histochemical ex-
pression may be affected by various factors, such as transforming
growth factor-a (TGF-a) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-
BB), which are also susceptible in mechanically transduced forces and
hypoxia occurring in CHD [37,38] . Thus, these results must be
interpreted with caution. The observed correlation between endothelial
nitric oxide synthase and VEGF expression con ﬁned in patients with
PAH persisting after surgical correction of the underlying defect may
imply the presence of neoangiogenesis as a marker of advanced,
irreversible pulmonary vascular disease.
5. Limitations
The majority of the studies included in the systematic review are
characterized by heterogeneous study populations, both in terms of
the spectrum of the underlying congenital heart disease and the age of
the patients, as expected in CHD. Most of the studies were retrospectiveTable 3

volved small patient numbers covering a wide ﬁeld of CHD complicated
or not with Eisenmenger physiology. These studies are usually under-
powered to establish signi ﬁcant correlations between levels of bio-
markers and hemodynamic parameters and, especially, prognosis.
However, according to the latest international guidelines [39]BNP/NT-
proBNP plasma levels should be recommended for initial risk strati ﬁca-
tion and may be considered for monitoring the effects of treatment in
PAH. Based on the current systematic review this may be extrapolated
to the CHD –PAH population, although more evidence is clearly required
for validating this data and for establishing prognostic cut-off values, in
absolute and serial measurements.
6. Conclusions
Our systematic review has shown that blood biomarkers of right
heart dysfunction, endothelial in ﬂammation and cellular proliferation
might be used in the evaluation and risk strati ﬁcation in patients with
CHD–PAH. Clearly, further, larger and prospective studies are required
to establish their routine use in this patient population. Given the
challenges in assessing right ventricular function and the subtle and in-
sidious onset of symptoms in patients with CHD –PAH, the use of blood
markers and their potential role in risk strati ﬁcation and management is
warranted.
